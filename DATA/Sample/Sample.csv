"What is the fastest way to get the value of π?","<p>I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of π, as a personal challenge. More specifically, I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code> constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p>

<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

    return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
}

main()
{
    int i;
    clock_t time1, time2;
    double diff;

    /* Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would
     * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op), if -fno-builtin

</code></pre>

<p>And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (<code>build.sh</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

<p>Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too because the optimizations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. But still, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version still comes out on top every time.</p>

    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in since it converted each character into is a byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse every two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

"How would you access Object properties from within an object method?","<p>What is the ""purist"" or ""correct"" way to access an object's properties from within an object method that is not a getter/setter method?</p>

<p>I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>String property = this.property;

<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

"How to export data from SQL Server 2005 to MySQL","<p>I've been banging my head against <code>SQL Server 2005</code> trying to get a lot of data out.  I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.  My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated, so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.</p>

<p>What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?</p>

<p>Does anybody know of such a tool?  I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string. I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I don't care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that, but I need the initial set of data in fast!</p>

"XSD DataSets and ignoring foreign keys","<p>I have a pretty standard table set-up in a current application using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework"" rel=""noreferrer"">.NET</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">XSD</a> <code>DataSet</code> and <code>TableAdapter</code> features. My <code>contracts</code> table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the <code>primary department</code>. This column is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key"" rel=""noreferrer"">foreign key</a> to my <code>Departments</code> table, where I store the basic <code>department name</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>notes</code>. This is all setup and functioning in my <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"" rel=""noreferrer"">SQL Server</a>.</p>

<p>When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.</p>

<p>However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data, I typically do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()

taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)
</code></pre>

<p>However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the <code>Contract DataTable</code> filled.</p>

<p>How can I fix this problem? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.</p>

"Upgrading SQL Server 6.5","<p>Yes, I know.  The existence of a running copy of <code>SQL Server 6.5</code> in 2008 is absurd.</p>

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from <code>6.5</code> to <code>2005</code>?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading <code>6.5</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>Should I forget about the native <code>SQL Server</code> upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Execute <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s <code>instcat.sql</code> against <code>6.5</code>'s Master.  This allows <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s OLEDB provider to connect to <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s standalone <code>""Import and Export Data""</code> to create a DTS package, using <code>OLEDB</code> to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>'s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>6.5</code>'s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>
<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>'s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the <code>6.5 database</code> are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.

"Unload a COM control when working in VB6 IDE","<p>Part of my everyday work is maintaining and extending legacy VB6 applications. A common engine is written in C/C++ and VB6 uses these functions in order to improve performance. </p>

<p>When it comes to asynchronous programming, a C interface is not enough and we rely on COM controls to fire events to VB6.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I register the control in VB6, VB loads this control in memory and does not unload it until I quit the VB6 IDE. As the control is loaded the whole time, I am unable to recompile it in VC6, because the DLL file is locked.</p>

<p>A solution I found is not to enable the control in VB but use the <code>CreateObject()</code> with the full name of my control. The problem then is that I must declare my control as an Object because VB6 knows nothing of the interface I am using and I do not have access to IntelliSense, which is a pain.</p>

<p>Any idea how I can tell VB6 to unload controls after quitting the application or directly in the IDE ?</p>

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

<li>Add last updated DATETIME column and check it matches when we update, if not then show differences. <em>- requires new column in each of the relevant tables.</em></li>

"Heap corruption under Win32; how to locate?","<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor?</p>

<p>HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the ""No Setup, Just Extract and Run"" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem.</p>

<p>So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make.</p>

<p>CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.</p>

"Why am I getting a double free or corruption error with realloc()?","<p>I've tried to write a string replace function in C, which works on a <code>char *</code>, which has been allocated using <code>malloc()</code>.  It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
    int searchLen = strlen(search);
    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
    char *find = input;

    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {

        if (delta &gt; 0) {
            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
            find = strstr(input, search);            
        }

        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

int main(void) {
    char *input = malloc(81);

"What is the most efficient graph data structure in Python?","<p>I need to be able to manipulate a large (10^7 nodes) graph in python. The data corresponding to each node/edge is minimal, say, a small number of strings. What is the most efficient, in terms of <strong><em>memory and speed</em></strong>, way of doing this? </p>

<p>A dict of dicts is more flexible and simpler to implement, but I intuitively expect a list of lists to be faster. The list option would also require that I keep the data separate from the structure, while dicts would allow for something of the sort:</p>

<pre><code>graph[I][J][""Property""]=""value""

<p>What would you suggest?</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, I should have been a bit clearer on what I mean by efficiency. In this particular case I mean it in terms of random access retrieval.</p>

<p>Loading the data in to memory isn't a huge problem. That's done once and for all. The time consuming part is visiting the nodes so I can extract the information and measure the metrics I'm interested in.</p>

<p>I hadn't considered making each node a class (properties are the same for all nodes) but it seems like that would add an extra layer of overhead? I was hoping someone would have some direct experience with a similar case that they could share. After all, graphs are one of the most common abstractions in CS.</p>

Now, I would like to update it so that the server can actually send a message to the client to request data.  As I currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server, this doesn't allow for the server to send a request at any time.  I would have to wait for client data.  My first thought would be to create another thread on the client with a separate open socket, listening for server requests...just like the server already has in respect the client.  Is there a way, within the same thread and using the same socket, to all the server to send requests at any time?</p>

"Different Distributed Version Control Systems working together","<p>My office has a central Source Safe 2005 install that we use for source control. I can't change what the office uses on the server. </p>

<p>I develop on a laptop and would like to have a different local source control repository that can sync with the central server (when available) regardless of the what that central provider is. The reason for the request is so I can maintain a local stable branch/build for client presentations while continuing to develop without having to jump through flaming hoops. Also, as a consultant, my clients may request that I use their source control provider and flexibility here would make life easier.</p>

<p>Can any of the existing distributed source control clients handle that?</p>

"Hiding inherited members","<p>I'm looking for some way to effectively hide inherited members. I have a library of classes which inherit from common base classes.  Some of the more recent descendant classes inherit dependency properties which have become vestigial and can be a little confusing when using <em>IntelliSense</em> or using the classes in a visual designer.</p>

<p>These classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either WPF or Silverlight 2.0.  I know about <code>ICustomTypeDescriptor</code> and <code>ICustomPropertyProvider</code>, but I'm pretty certain those can't be used in Silverlight.  </p>

<p>It's not as much a functional issue as a usability issue.  What should I do?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Some of the properties that I would really like to hide come from ancestors that are not my own and because of a specific tool I'm designing for, I can't do member hiding with the <code>new</code> operator.  (I know, it's ridiculous)</p>

"Reducing duplicate error handling code in C#?","<p>I've never been completely happy with the way exception handling works, there's a lot exceptions and try/catch brings to the table (stack unwinding, etc.), but it seems to break a lot of the OO model in the process.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>

<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>

<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));
bool success = false;
while (!success)
{
    try
    {
        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail
        success = true;
    }
    catch (IOException e)
    {
        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)
        {
            throw e;
        }
        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>

<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()
    {
        // some code block
    } );
</code></pre>

<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.</p>

"Mechanisms for tracking DB schema changes","<p>What are the best methods for tracking and/or automating DB schema changes?  Our team uses Subversion for version control and we've been able to automate some of our tasks this way (pushing builds up to a staging server, deploying tested code to a production server) but we're still doing database updates manually.  I would like to find or create a solution that allows us to work efficiently across servers with different environments while continuing to use Subversion as a backend through which code and DB updates are pushed around to various servers.</p>

<p>Many popular software packages include auto-update scripts which detect DB version and apply the necessary changes.  Is this the best way to do this even on a larger scale (across multiple projects and sometimes multiple environments and languages)?  If so, is there any existing code out there that simplifies the process or is it best just to roll our own solution?  Has anyone implemented something similar before and integrated it into Subversion post-commit hooks, or is this a bad idea?</p>

<p>While a solution that supports multiple platforms would be preferable, we definitely need to support the Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP stack as the majority of our work is on that platform.</p>

"Triple Quotes? How do I delimit a databound Javascript string parameter in ASP.NET?","<p>How do I delimit a Javascript data-bound string parameter in an anchor <code>OnClick</code> event?</p>
<ul>
<li>I have an anchor tag in an ASP.NET Repeater control.</li>
<li>The <code>OnClick</code> event of the anchor contains a call to a Javascript function.</li>
<li>The Javascript function takes a string for its input parameter.</li>
<li>The string parameter is populated with a data-bound value from the Repeater.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need the &quot;double quotes&quot; for the <code>Container.DataItem</code>.<br />
I need the 'single quotes' for the <code>OnClick</code>.</p>
<p>And I still need <em>one more delimiter</em> (triple quotes?) for the input string parameter of the Javascript function call.</p>
<p>Since I can't use 'single quotes' again, how do I ensure the Javascript function knows the input parameter is a string and not an integer?</p>
<p>Without the extra quotes around the input string parameter, the Javascript function thinks I'm passing in an integer.</p>
<p>The anchor:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a id=&quot;aShowHide&quot; onclick='ToggleDisplay(&lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, &quot;JobCode&quot;) %&gt;);' &gt;Show/Hide&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Then I have one more latitude/longitude pair. I want to plot it on the map as best is possible. How do I go about doing this?</p>

<p>You can't assume North is up: all you have is the existing lat/long->x/y mappings.</p>

<p>EDIT: it's not a Mercator projection, or anything like that. It's arbitrarily distorted for readability (think subway map). I want to use only the nearest 5 to 10 mappings so that distortion on other parts of the map doesn't affect the mapping I'm trying to compute.</p>

"How to RedirectToAction in ASP.NET MVC without losing request data","<p>Using ASP.NET MVC there are situations (such as form submission) that may require a <code>RedirectToAction</code>.  </p>

"Are Multiple DataContext classes ever appropriate?","<p>In order to fully use LinqToSql in an ASP.net 3.5 application, it is necessary to create <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.linq.datacontext.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">DataContext</a> <a href=""http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/csharp/InsideTheLINQToSQLDataContextClass.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">classes</a> (which is usually done using the designer in VS 2008). From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.</p>

<p>My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or experience on whether multiple DataContexts (corresponding to DB namespaces) are appropriate in place of (or in addition to) one very large DataContext class (corresponding to the whole DB)?</p>

"Tracking state using ASP.NET AJAX / ICallbackEventHandler","<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (""OnColumnMoved"" or ""OnRowMoved"").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

"Read binary file into a struct","<p>I'm trying to read binary data using C#. I have all the information about the layout of the data in the files I want to read. I'm able to read the data ""chunk by chunk"", i.e. getting the first 40 bytes of data converting it to a string, get the next 40 bytes.</p>

<p>Since there are at least three slightly different version of the data, I would like to read the data directly into a struct. It just feels so much more right than by reading it ""line by line"".</p>

<p><strong>I have tried the following approach but to no avail:</strong></p>

<pre><code>StructType aStruct;
int count = Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(StructType));
byte[] readBuffer = new byte[count];
BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(stream);
readBuffer = reader.ReadBytes(count);
GCHandle handle = GCHandle.Alloc(readBuffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
aStruct = (StructType) Marshal.PtrToStructure(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), typeof(StructType));
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<p>The stream is an opened FileStream from which I have began to read from. I get an <code>AccessViolationExceptio</code>n when using <code>Marshal.PtrToStructure</code>.</p>

<p>The stream contains more information than I'm trying to read since I'm not interested in data at the end of the file.</p>

<p><strong>The struct is defined like:</strong></p>

<pre><code>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
struct StructType
{
    [FieldOffset(0)]
    public string FileDate;
    [FieldOffset(8)]

<p>I also know that when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector (although this may take time).</p>

<p>So with this in mind will setting it to <code>null</code> speed up the system releasing the memory as it does not have to work out that it is no longer in scope and are they any bad side effects?</p>

I first tried to use the Visual Studio plugin that will convert a csproj into a makefile, but there seemed to be no version available for Visual Studio 2005. I also read about the MonoDevelop IDE, which sounded nice. Unfortunately, there's no pre-fab Windows package for it. I tried to follow some instructions to build it by combining dependencies from other semi-related installs. It didn't work, but that's probably because I'm a Windows-oriented guy and can barely spell ""makefile"".</p>

<p>So, my question is this: What's the lowest-energy way to get up and running to try some Mono-based development on Windows?</p>

"How should I translate from screen space coordinates to image space coordinates in a WinForms PictureBox?","<p>I have an application that displays an image inside of a Windows Forms <code>PictureBox</code> control.  The <code>SizeMode</code> of the control is set to <code>Zoom</code> so that the image contained in the <code>PictureBox</code> will be displayed in an aspect-correct way regardless of the dimensions of the <code>PictureBox</code>.</p>

<p>This is great for the visual appearance of the application because you can size the window however you want and the image will always be displayed using its best fit.  Unfortunately, I also need to handle mouse click events on the picture box and need to be able to translate from screen-space coordinates to image-space coordinates.</p>

<p>It looks like it's easy to translate from screen space to control space, but I don't see any obvious way to translate from control space to image space (i.e. the pixel coordinate in the source image that has been scaled in the picture box).</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to do this, or should I just duplicate the scaling math that they're using internally to position the image and do the translation myself?</p>

"Possible to ""spin off"" several GUI threads? (Not halting the system at Application.Run)","<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <code>IComponent</code> interface with a single method <code>DoStuff()</code>.</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <code>IComponent</code>. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run <code>DoStuff()</code> to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code>. It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code> (the exact line of code is when the component runs <code>Application.Run(theForm)</code>), the component and hence our system ""hangs"" at the <code>Application.Run()</code> line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent
{
    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }
}

public class MyComponent2: IComponent
{
    public void DoStuff()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new Form());

        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI 
        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>public void DoStuff()
{
    new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()
}

private void ThreadedInitialize()
{
    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
    Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
    Application.Run(new Form());
}

I would like to use it in a more <em>JXTA</em> way since I am making changes to move to 2.5 anyway.</p>

"Can you force either a scalar or array ref to be an array in Perl?","<p>I have a perl variable <code>$results</code> that gets returned from a service.  The value is supposed to be an array, and <code>$results</code> should be an array reference.  However, when the array has only one item in it, <code>$results</code> will be set to that value, and not a referenced array that contains that one item.</p>

<p>I want to do a <code>foreach</code> loop on the expected array.  Without checking <code>ref($results) eq 'ARRAY'</code>, is there any way to have something equivalent to the following:</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $result (@$results) {
    # Process $result
}
</code></pre>

<p>That particular code sample will work for the reference, but will complain for the simple scalar.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should clarify that there is no way for me to change what is returned from the service.  The problem is that the value will be a scalar when there is only one value and it will be an array reference when there is more than one value.</p>

"Peak detection of measured signal","<p>We use a data acquisition card to take readings from a device that increases its signal to a peak and then falls back to near the original value. To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.</p>

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?</p>

"Timer-based event triggers","<p>I am currently working on a project with specific requirements.  A brief overview of these are as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Data is retrieved from external webservices</li>
<li>Data is stored in SQL 2005</li>
<li>Data is manipulated via a web GUI</li>
<li>The windows service that communicates with the web services has no coupling with our internal web UI, except via the database.</li>
<li>Communication with the web services needs to be both time-based, and triggered via user intervention on the web UI.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current (pre-pre-production) model for web service communication triggering is via a database table that stores trigger requests generated from the manual intervention.  I do not really want to have multiple trigger mechanisms, but would like to be able to populate the database table with triggers based upon the time of the call.  As I see it there are two ways to accomplish this.</p>

<p>1) Adapt the trigger table to store two extra parameters.  One being ""Is this time-based or manually added?"" and a nullable field to store the timing details (exact format to be determined).  If it is a manaully created trigger, mark it as processed when the trigger has been fired, but not if it is a timed trigger.<br>
<em>or</em><br>
2) Create a second windows service that creates the triggers on-the-fly at timed intervals.</p>

<p>The second option seems like a fudge to me, but the management of option 1 could easily turn into a programming nightmare (how do you know if the last poll of the table returned the event that needs to fire, and how do you then stop it re-triggering on the next poll)</p>

<p>I'd appreciate it if anyone could spare a few minutes to help me decide which route (one of these two, or possibly a third, unlisted one) to take.</p>

what my options are.</p>

<p>Downsides to ClickOnce:</p>

<li>Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.</li>
<li>You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet)</li>
<li>Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.</li>

<li>It works. Magically. And it's built

<li>Makes it easy to upgrade the

"How to create a tree-view preferences dialog type of interface in C#?","<p>I'm writing an application that is basically just a preferences dialog, much like the tree-view preferences dialog that Visual Studio itself uses. The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be.</p>

<p>What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVRJB.png"" alt=""form design""></p>

<p>Basically I have to work with this huge form, with container controls all over the place, and then do a bunch of run-time reformatting to make it all work. This seems like a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Am I doing this in a totally stupid way? Is there some ""obvious"" easier way of doing this that I'm missing?</p>

"Sharepoint: executing stsadm from a timer job + SHAREPOINT\System rights","<p>I have an unusual situation in which I need a SharePoint timer job to both have local administrator windows privileges and to have <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges.</p>

<p>I can get the windows privileges by simply configuring the timer service to use an account which is a member of local administrators. I understand that this is not a good solution since it gives SharePoint timer service more rights then it is supposed to have. But it at least allows my SharePoint timer job to run <code>stsadm</code>.</p>

<p>Another problem with running the timer service under local administrator is that this user won't necessarily have <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges which I also need for this SharePoint job. It turns out that <code>SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> won't work in this case. Reflector shows that <code>RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> checks if the current process is <code>owstimer</code> (the service process which runs SharePoint jobs) and performs no elevation this is the case (the rational here, I guess, is that the timer service is supposed to run under <code>NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService</code> windows account which which has <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges, and thus there's no need to elevate privileges for a timer job).</p>

<p>The only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual NetworkService windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to System.Diagnostics.Process.Run() trough the StarInfo's Username, domain and password.</p>

<p>It seems everything should work now, but here is another problem I'm stuck with at the moment. Stsamd is failing with the following error popup (!) (Winternals filemon shows that stsadm is running under the administrator in this case):</p>

<p><code>The application failed to initialize properly (0x0c0000142).</code> <br />
<code>Click OK to terminate the application.</code></p>

<p>Event Viewer registers nothing except the popup.</p>

<p>The local administrator user is my account and when I just run <code>stsadm</code> interactively under this account everything is ok. It also works fine when I configure the timer service to run under this account.</p>

"Full complete MySQL database replication? Ideas? What do people do?","<p>Currently I have two Linux servers running MySQL, one sitting on a rack right next to me under a 10 Mbit/s upload pipe (main server) and another some couple of miles away on a 3 Mbit/s upload pipe (mirror).</p>

<p>I want to be able to replicate data on both servers continuously, but have run into several roadblocks. One of them being, under MySQL master/slave configurations, every now and then, some statements drop (!), meaning; some people logging on to the mirror URL don't see data that I know is on the main server and vice versa. Let's say this happens on a meaningful block of data once every month, so I can live with it and assume it's a ""lost packet"" issue (i.e., god knows, but we'll compensate).</p>

<p>The other most important (and annoying) recurring issue is that, when for some reason we do a major upload or update (or reboot) on one end and have to <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sever"" rel=""noreferrer"">sever</a> the link, then LOAD DATA FROM MASTER doesn't work and I have to manually dump on one end and upload on the other, quite a task nowadays moving some .5 TB worth of data.</p>

<p>Is there software for this? I know MySQL (the ""corporation"") offers this as a VERY expensive service (full database replication). What do people out there do?

"How do I add SSL to a .net application that uses httplistener - it will *not* be running on IIS","<p><strong>Most recent edits in bold</strong>
I am using the .net <code>HttpListener</code> class, but I won't be running this application on IIS and am not using ASP.net.  This <a href=""http://www.leastprivilege.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=0c34094a-bdd4-4041-be6e-919f10fe1d31"" rel=""noreferrer"">web site</a> describes what code to actually use to implement SSL with asp.net and <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adarshk/archive/2004/11/10/255467.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this site</a> describes how to set up the certificates (although I'm not sure if it works only for IIS or not).  </p>

<p>The class documentation describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) --- none of them refer to SSL.  It does say that if <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate</a>.  Is this going to be a one line property setting and <code>HttpListener</code> figures out the rest?  </p>

<p>In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement SSL.</p>

<p>Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is ""Schannel"" and the content of the message is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fatal error occurred when attempting
  to access the SSL server credential
  private key. The error code returned
  from the cryptographic module is
  0x80090016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:<br>
<strong>Steps taken so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. ""<a href=""http://localhost:8089/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8089/foldername/</a>""</li>
<li>Created a certificate using makecert.exe</li>
<li>Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe</li>
<li>Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090)</li>
<li>Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(<a href=""https://localhost:8090/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://localhost:8090/foldername/</a>"");</li>
<li>tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (<a href=""http://localhost:8089/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8089/foldername/</a>"") in a browser and receive correct return</li>
<li>tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (<a href=""http://localhost:8090/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8090/foldername/</a>"") in a browser and receive ""Data Transfer Interrupted"" (in Firefox)</li>
<li>debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier.</li>
<li>netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP.  the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fiddler</a> and <a href=""http://www.ieinspector.com/httpanalyzer/"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTPAnalyzer</a> don't catch any of the traffic, I guess it doesn't get far enough in the process to show up in those HTTP analysis tools</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What could the problem be? </li>
<li>Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done)</li>
<li>Have a missed a configuration step somewhere? </li>
<li>What else might I do to analyze the problem?</li>

"SVN merge merged extra stuff","<p>I just did a merge using something like:</p>

<pre><code>svn merge -r 67212:67213 https://my.svn.repository/trunk .

<p>I only had 2 files, one of which is a simple <code>ChangeLog</code>.  Rather than just merging my <code>ChangeLog</code> changes, it actually pulled mine plus some previous ones that were not in the destination <code>ChangeLog</code>.  I noticed there was a conflict when I executed --dry-run, so I updated <code>ChangeLog</code>, and there was still a conflict (and I saw the conflict when I did the actual merge).</p>

<p>I then later diffed on the file I was merging from:</p>

<pre><code>svn diff -r 67212:67213 ChangeLog
</code></pre>

<p>And I see just the changes I had made, so I know that extra changes didn't get in there somehow. </p>

<p>This makes me worried that merge is not actually just taking what I changed, which is what I would have expected.  Can anybody explain what happened?</p>

<p>UPDATE: In response to NilObject:</p>

<p>So, I have 2 files changed, only ChangeLog is relevant, the other merged fine.  When I go to my regular trunk checkout, I do the diff command above and see:</p>

"ConfigurationManager.AppSettings Performance Concerns","<p>I plan to be storing all my config settings in my application's app.config section (using the <code>ConfigurationManager.AppSettings</code> class). As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the <code>AppSettings</code>. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the <code>AppSettings</code> constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the <code>AppSettings</code> constantly.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using <code>AppSettings</code> is supposed to be ""the right way"" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>

<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>

<p>According to the MSDN documention, the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because <code>Properties</code> does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>

<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties. That is so far above and beyond what my application will <em>ever</em> even come close to needing that I feel quite safe in using Properties without impacting performance.</p>

<p>Now, I use those objects in both <code>script.php</code> and <code>/soap/soap.php</code>, I could move them, but I want the directory structure like that for a specific reason. When executing <code>script.php</code> the include path is <code>inc/include.php</code> and when executing <code>/soap/soap.php</code> it's <code>../inc</code>, absolute paths work, <code>/mnt/webdev/[project name]/inc/include1.php...</code> But it's an ugly solution if I ever want to move the directory to a different location.</p>

"Vista or XP for Dev Machine","<p>I am about to get a new PC from work, and it will include the option to have either Vista Business as the OS, or a downgrade to XP Pro. Aside from a tiny bit of testing, I have never used Vista, but overall I have heard many more bad reports than good regarding Vista. I don't think that hardware will be an issue (Intel Core Duo T9300, 4GB RAM, 256MB NVIDIA) in terms of performance.

"Using ConfigurationManager to load config from an arbitrary location","<p>I'm developing a data access component that will be used in a website that contains a mix of classic ASP and ASP.NET pages, and need a good way to manage its configuration settings.</p>

<p>I'd like to use a custom <code>ConfigurationSection</code>, and for the ASP.NET pages this works great.  But when the component is called via COM interop from a classic ASP page, the component isn't running in the context of an ASP.NET request and therefore has no knowledge of web.config.</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> to just load the configuration from an arbitrary path (e.g. <code>..\web.config</code> if my assembly is in the <code>/bin</code> folder)?

"MOSS SSP Issue - Failed database logons from deleted SSP","<p>We've been having some issues with a SharePoint instance in a test
environment. Thankfully this is not production ;) The problems started
when the disk with the SQL Server databases and search index ran out
of space. Following this, the search service would not run and search
settings in the SSP were not accessible. Reclaiming the disk space did
not resolve the issue. So rather than restoring the VM, we decided to
try to fix the issue.</p>

<p>We created a new SSP and changed the association of all services to
the new SSP. The old SSP and it's databases were then deleted. Search
results for PDF files are no longer appearing, but the search works
fine otherwise. MySites also works OK.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of this change, these problems occur:</p>

<p>One method I have is one to find all the codes and remove them, so I can render the text without any formatting if needed:</p>

<pre><code>    
public static string StripStringFormating(string formattedString)
{
    if (rTest.IsMatch(formattedString))
        return rTest.Replace(formattedString, string.Empty);
    else

<pre><code>static Regex rText = new Regex(@""\e\[[\d;]+m"", RegexOptions.Compiled);</code></pre>

<p>However, this failed if the escape code was incomplete due to an error on the server. So then this was suggested, but my friend warned it might be slower (this one also matches another condition (z) that I might come across later):</p>

<pre><code>static Regex rTest = 
              new Regex(@""(\e(\[([\d;]*[mz]?))?)?"", RegexOptions.Compiled);</code></pre>

"Locking a SQL Server Database with PHP","<p>I'm wanting extra security for a particular point in my web app. So I want to lock the database (SQL Server 2005). Any suggestions or is this even necessary with SQL Server?</p>

<p><strong>Edit on question:</strong></p>

<p>The query is failing silently with no errors messages logged, and does not occur inside of a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Final Solution:</strong></p>

<p>I never was able to solve the problem, however what I wound up doing was switching to MySQL and using a transactional level query here. This was not the main or even a primary reason to switch. I had been having problems with SQL Server and it allowed me to have our CMS and various other tools all running on the same database. Previous we had a SQL Server and a MySQL database running to run our site. The port was a bit on the time consuming however in the long run I feel it will work much better for the site and the business.</p>

"Learning Ruby on Rails any good for Grails?","<p>My company is in the process of starting down the <strong>Grails</strong> path. The reason for that is that the current developers are heavy on <strong>Java</strong> but felt the need for a <strong>MVC-style language</strong> for some future web development projects.

    public string Description { get; set; }
}

var MyProducts = new  List&lt;MyProduct&gt;

    },

    {
        Name = ""Leash"",

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long. It should never change from 3, through.</p>

The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

"Why can't I use a try block around my super() call?","<p>So, in Java, the first line of your constructor HAS to be a call to super... be it implicitly calling super(), or explicitly calling another constructor.  What I want to know is, why can't I put a try block around that?</p>

<p>My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is effectively this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public MyClassMock() {
        try {
            super(0);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>But Java complains that super isn't the first statement.</p>

<p>My workaround:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public static MyClassMock construct() {
        try {
            return new MyClassMock();
        } catch (Exception e) {

<p>Is this the best workaround?  Why doesn't Java let me do the former?</p>

<p>My best guess as to the ""why"" is that Java doesn't want to let me have a constructed object in a potentially inconsistent state... however, in doing a mock, I don't care about that.  It seems I should be able to do the above... or at least I know that the above is safe for my case... or seems as though it should be anyways.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:variable name=""myId"" select=""@id"" /&gt;
&lt;xsl value-of select=""//Root/Some/Other/Path/Where[@id='{@myId}']/@Name /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That does not work.  If I replace the {@myId} with the value that is in the variable then it does find the right node, but doign it this way produces nothing.  I'm sure I'm missing something, or perhaps there is a different way to do it.</p>

<p>The context is that there is related data under different top-level nodes that share the same id value so I need to get the related nodes in my template.</p>

"SQL Server 2008 FileStream on a Web Server","

<p>I've been developing a site using ASP.NET MVC, and have decided to use the new SQL Server 2008 <code>FILESTREAM</code> facility to store files 'within' the database rather than as separate entities.  While initially working within VS2008 (using a trusted connection to the database), everything was fine and dandy.  Issues arose, however, when I shifted the site to IIS7 and changed over to SQL authentication on the database.</p>

<p>It seems that streaming a <code>FILESTREAM</code> doesn't work with SQL authentication, only with Windows authentication.  Given this, what is the best practice to follow?</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way to force this sort of thing to work under SQL authentication?</li>
<li>Should I add <code>NETWORK SERVICE</code> as a database user and then use Trusted authentication?</li>
<li>Should I create another user, and run both the IIS site and the database connection under this?</li>

"Telligent's Community Server","<p>The company I work for is wanting to add blog functionality to our website and they were looking to spend an awful amount of money to have some crap being built on top of a CMS they purchased (sitecore).  I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. 
My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br />
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>

<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>

<p>another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.  ExpressionEngine looks promising, will try it out on my personal box.</p>

So, my feeling is that the only reason you would even consider using J# is that management has decreed that the company should jump on the Java bandwagon... and the .NET bandwagon.  If you use J#, you are effectively losing the biggest benefit of picking Java... rich cross platform support.  Sure there is Mono, but it's not as richly supported or as full featured right?  I remember hearing Forms are not fully (perhaps at all) supported.</p>

"Tables with no Primary Key","<p>I have several tables whose only unique data is a uniqueidentifier (a Guid) column.

<p>I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (""identity"") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.</p>

<p>My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.</p>

The calling procedure cannot target any procedures within the same package.<br>
The calling procedure can target outside sites (both http, https).<br>

<p>After seeing that message from the server, I kicked around Fiddler a bit more to see what else I could learn from it. Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the ""<code>xxx_DISPLAYED_</code>"" fields above were in it. </p>

<p>I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web <code>PLSQL</code> code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of <code>IE6</code> for me, as Firefox worked fine.</p>

<p>Yes, it's for debugging purposes only.  Unfortunately, CURRENT within an SPL will always return the same value, set at the entry to the call:</p>

<p>Wrapping CURRENT in its own subroutine does not help.  You do get a different answer on the first call to your wrapper (provided you're using YEAR TO FRACTION(5) or some other type with high enough resolution to show the the difference) but then you get that same value back on every single subsequent call, which ensures that any sort of loop will never terminate.</p>

"Binary patch-generation in C#","<p>Does anyone have, or know of, a binary patch generation algorithm implementation in C#?</p>

<p>Basically, compare two files (designated <em>old</em> and <em>new</em>), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the <em>old</em> file to have the same contents as the <em>new</em> file.</p>

<p>The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>

<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>

<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>

<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>

<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>
<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>
<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>
<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>
<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>
<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>
<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>
</ol>

<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>

<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>

<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>

<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>

<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>

<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/lvknet/source/browse/trunk/LVK/IO/Patching/Binary/BinaryPatch.cs"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source code to the above algorithm</a></p>

<p>You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems. I don't know how to resolve that so for the time being just accept the certificate.</p>

<p>The source uses lots of other types from the rest of my library so that file isn't all it takes, but that's the algorithm implementation.</p>

<hr>

<p>@lomaxx, I have tried to find a good documentation for the algorithm used in subversion, called xdelta, but unless you already know how the algorithm works, the documents I've found fail to tell me what I need to know.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I'm just dense... :)</p>

<p>I took a quick peek on the algorithm from that site you gave, and it is unfortunately not usable. A comment from the binary diff file says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finding an optimal set of differences requires quadratic time relative to the input size, so it becomes unusable very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My needs aren't optimal though, so I'm looking for a more practical solution.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer though, added a bookmark to his utilities if I ever need them.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Note, I will look at his code to see if I can find some ideas, and I'll also send him an email later with questions, but I've read that book he references and though the solution is good for finding optimal solutions, it is impractical in use due to the time requirements.</p>

"WCF Service - Backward compatibility issue","<p>I'm just getting into creating some WCF services, but I have a requirement to make them backward compatible for legacy (.NET 1.1 and 2.0) client applications.  </p>

<p>I've managed to get the services to run correctly for 3.0 and greater clients, but when I publish the services using a basicHttpBinding endpoint (which I believe is required for the compatibility I need), the service refactors my method signatures.  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783
</code></pre>

<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also ""leaks"" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>

<p>Would a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid"" rel=""noreferrer"">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>

<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of ""security through obscurity"" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>

<p>Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.</p>

"Best way to abstract season/show/episode data","<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1
</code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the <code>Tvdb()</code> class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended <code>Dict()</code> that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if <code>x[3][24]</code> was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception).</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes: <code>ShowContainer</code>, <code>Show</code>, <code>Season</code> and <code>Episode</code>. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the <code>search()</code> function on <code>Show()</code> for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code>.</p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's <code>self.data</code> dict, if not, <code>raise season_not_found</code>. I can also check in <code>Season()</code> if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code> functions, it's easy to accidentally recursively call <code>__getitem__</code> (so I'm not sure if extending the <code>Dict</code> class will cause problems).</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old <code>Dict</code> method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See <code>_setItem</code> and <code>_setData</code>. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly... Elegant.</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the <code>ShowContainer</code>/etc classes with <code>Dict</code> cause problems?</p>

"Gathering OS and tool version numbers for build archive purposes","<p>Our automated build machine needs to archive the version numbers of the OS plus various tools used during each build.

<p>Does anyone know of a way to easily archive the version numbers of the Visual Studio tools?</p>

<p>What mechanisms do other developers use to gather this kind of information for archive purposes?</p>

<hr>

<p>Extra information for Fabio Gomes.</p>

<p>I agree with you that in 5 years time it'll probably be impossible to recreate the exact OS and tool configuration (down to the nearest security update).  Unfortunately this really comes from a contractual requirement.  As part of our deliverable to a customer we must provide a copy of all source code and clear instructions on exactly how to replicate the build.  It's probably impossible for us to meet this requirement perfectly.</p>

<p>So - I'll just mark your answer as correct (I agree with you that it's practically impossible), and get on with playing with the rest of stack overflow. :)</p>

"Normalizing a Table with Low Integrity","<p>I've been handed a table with about 18000 rows. Each record describes the location of one customer. The issue is, that when the person created the table, they did not add a field for ""Company Name"", only ""Location Name,"" and one company can have many locations.</p>

<p>For example, here are some records that describe the same customer:</p>

<p><strong>Location Table</strong></p>

 2   Town Shop - Loc 2 
 3   The Town Shop     
 4   TTS - Someplace   
 5   Town Shop,the 3   
 6   Toen Shop4        
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to make it look like:</p>

<p><strong>Location Table</strong></p>

<pre><code> ID  Company_ID   Location_Name     
 1   1            Town Shop#1       
 2   1            Town Shop - Loc 2 
 3   1            The Town Shop

<p><strong>Company Table</strong></p>

<pre><code> Company_ID  Company_Name  
 1           The Town Shop 
</code></pre>

<p>There is no ""Company"" table, I will have to generate the Company Name list from the most descriptive or best Location Name that represents the multiple locations.</p>

"What is the best way to store connection string in .NET DLLs?","<p>The application my team is currently developing has a DLL that is used to perform all database access.  The application can not use a trusted connection because the database is behind a firewall and the domain server is not.  So it appears that the connection string needs to have a DB username and password.  The DLL currently has the database connection string hard coded, but I don't want to do this when we launch as the assembly can be disassembled and the username and password would be right there in the open.</p>

<p>One of the requirements is that the password needs to be changed once every few months, so we would need to roll that out to our internal user base.</p>

<p>Is there a way to store the password encrypted in such a way we can easily distribute to the entire user base without storing it in the assembly?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who's answered.  I'll try to answer some of the questions back to me...  The data DLL is used by both ASP.NET WebForms and VB.NET WinForms.  I understand that Applications can have their own config files, but I haven't seen anything on config files for DLLs.  Unfortunately, I can't get to the Jon Galloway post at work so I can't judge if that will work.  From a development standpoint, we don't want to use web services inhouse, but may be providing them to third parties sometime next year.  I don't think impersonation will work because we can't authenticate the user through the firewall.  As a user (or former user) can be an attacker, we're keeping it from everyone!</p>

"How do you manage databases in development, test, and production?","<p>I've had a hard time trying to find good examples of how to manage database schemas and data between development, test, and production servers.</p>

<p>Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>

<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>

<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs ""release candidates."" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>

<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>

<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is ""base"" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>

<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>

<hr>

<p>A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?</p>

<hr>

<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest).</p>

                           lastRule=null]

I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include ""-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific"", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

I have an <code>ArrayList</code> of business objects bound to a  Windows Forms <code>DataGrid</code>.  I'd like the user to be able to edit the cells, and when finished,  press a Save button.  At that point I'd like to iterate the all the rows and columns in the  <code>DataGrid</code> to find any changes, and save them to the database.  But I can't find a way to  access the <code>DataGrid</code> rows.  </p>

<p>I'll also want to validate individual cells real time, as they are edited, but I'm pretty  sure that can be done.  (Maybe not with an <code>ArrayList</code> as the <code>DataSource</code>?)  But as for iterating the <code>DataGrid</code>, I'm quite surprised it doesn't seem possible.</p>

<p>Must I really stuff my business objects data into datatables in order to use the datagrid?  </p>

".NET 3.5 Redistributable -- 200 MB? Other options?","<p>I've been using a lot of new .NET 3.5 features in the work that I've been doing, lately. The application that I'm building is intended for distribution among consumers who will probably not have the latest version (or perhaps <em>any version</em>) of the .NET framework on their machines.</p>

<p>I went to go <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""noreferrer"">download the .NET 3.5 redistributable package</a> only to find out that it's almost <strong><em>200 MB!</em></strong> This is unacceptable for my application, because it's supposed to be a quick and painless consumer application that installs quickly and keeps a low profile on the user's machine. For users that have .NET 3.5 already installed, our binary downloads have been instantaneous, so far. This 200 MB gorilla will more than quadruple the size of the download. Is there any other option than this redistributable package that I can use to make sure the framework is on the machine that won't take the user out of our ""quick and painless"" workflow? Our target time from beginning of download to finalizing the install is less than two minutes. Is it just not possible for someone who doesn't already have .NET installed?</p>

"How can I enable disabled radio buttons?","<p>The following code works great in IE, but not in FF or Safari.  I can't for the life of me work out why.  The code is <em>supposed</em> to disable radio buttons if you select the &quot;Disable 2 radio buttons&quot; option.  It should enable the radio buttons if you select the &quot;Enable both radio buttons&quot; option.  These both work...</p>
<p>However, if you don't use your mouse to move between the 2 options (&quot;Enable...&quot; and &quot;Disable...&quot;) then the radio buttons do not appear to be disabled or enabled correctly, until you click anywhere else on the page (not on the radio buttons themselves).</p>

"JUnit vs TestNG","<p>At work we are currently still using JUnit 3 to run our tests. We have been considering switching over to JUnit 4 for <strong>new</strong> tests being written but I have been keeping an eye on TestNG for a while now. What experiences have you all had with either JUnit 4 or TestNG, and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests? Having flexibility in writing tests is also important to us since our functional tests cover a wide aspect and need to be written in a variety of ways to get results.</p>

<p>Old tests will not be re-written as they do their job just fine. What I would like to see in new tests though is flexibility in the way the test can be written, natural assertions, grouping, and easily distributed test executions.</p>

"ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion","<p>I'm still new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!</p>

<p>Let's say I have a standard business object ""Contact"" in the <em>Business</em> namespace. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p>

<p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a ""Contact"" and does some magic with it, like <code>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</code> say. Which of course takes the Contact of type <code>Business.Contact</code>.</p>

<p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <code>BuyContactNewHat</code> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p>

<pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact(""Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here
</code></pre>

<p>Since the return type of <code>GetContact</code> is of <code>MyWebService.Contact</code> and not <code>Business.Contact</code> as expected. I understand why this is because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL.</p>

<p>So, is there an ""easier"" way to deal with this type of mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure than simply transferring the values across from one to the other.</p>

<p>Overview:  a .xfdl file is a gzipped .xml file which has then been encoded in base64.  I wish to de-encode the .xfdl into xml which I can then modify and then re-encode back into a .xfdl file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>xfdl > xml.gz > xml > xml.gz > xfdl</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been able to take a .xfdl file and de-encode it from base64 using uudeview:</p>

<pre><code>uudeview -i yourform.xfdl
</code></pre>

<p>Then decommpressed it using gunzip</p>

<pre><code>gunzip -S """" &lt; UNKNOWN.001 &gt; yourform-unpacked.xml
</code></pre>

<p>The xml produced is 100% readable and looks wonderful.  Without modifying the xml then, i should be able to re-compress it using gzip:</p>

<pre><code>gzip yourform-unpacked.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Then re-encoded in base-64:</p>

<pre><code>base64 -e yourform-unpacked.xml.gz yourform_reencoded.xfdl
</code></pre>

<p>If my thinking is correct, the original file and the re-encoded file should be equal.  If I put yourform.xfdl and yourform_reencoded.xfdl into beyond compare, however, they do not match up.  Also, the original file can be viewed in an http://www.grants.gov/help/download_software.jsp#pureedge"">.xfdl viewer.  The viewer says that the re-encoded xfdl is unreadable.  </p>

"How do I best share an embeddable form in VB6?","<p>Is there a good way to create a form in VB6 that can easily be embedded inside other forms?</p>

<p>On a few occasions recently, I've wanted to design and code a Form object that I could plug into several other ""parent"" forms.  My goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several UI components in a particular way, and then be able to use that (both the UI layout and the logic) in more than one place.  I'm certainly willing to use code (rather than the Design View) to load the child form.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.  The class then knows how to operate on the picture, and it assumes that all its expected pieces have been laid out appropriately.  This approach has several downsides, and I'd like something a bit more elegant.</p>

"Multicore Text File Parsing","<p>I have a quad core machine and would like to write some code to parse a text file that takes advantage of all four cores. The text file basically contains one record per line.</p>

<p>Multithreading isn't my forte so I'm wondering if anyone could give me some patterns that I might be able to use to parse the file in an optimal manner.</p>

<p>My first thoughts are to read all the lines into some sort of queue and then spin up threads to pull the lines off the queue and process them, but that means the queue would have to exist in memory and these are fairly large files so I'm not so keen on that idea.</p>

<p>My next thoughts are to have some sort of controller that will read in a line and assign it a thread to parse, but I'm not sure if the controller will end up being a bottleneck if the threads are processing the lines faster than it can read and assign them.</p>

<p>I know there's probably another simpler solution than both of these but at the moment I'm just not seeing it.</p>

"When should I use type abstraction in embedded systems","<p>I've worked on a number of different embedded systems.  They have all used <code>typedef</code>s (or <code>#defines</code>) for types such as <code>UINT32</code>.</p>

<p>This is a good technique as it drives home the size of the type to the programmer and makes you more conscious of chances for overflow etc.</p>

<p>But on some systems you know that the compiler and processor won't change for the life of the project.</p>

<p>So what should influence your decision to create and enforce project-specific types?</p>

<p>EDIT
I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two.</p>

<p>With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM.  This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler.</p>

<p>For everything else the types have less importance.<br>
You need to be careful not to cause overflow and may need to watch out for register and stack usage.  Which may lead you to <code>UINT16</code>, <code>UCHAR</code>.
Using types such as <code>UCHAR</code> can add compiler 'fluff' however.  Because registers are typically larger, some compilers may add code to force the result into the type.<br>
<PRE>i++;</PRE>
can become
<PRE>ADD REG,1
AND REG, 0xFF</PRE>
which is unecessary.</p>

<p>So I think my question should have been :-</p>

<p>given the constraints of embedded software what is the best policy to set for a project which will have many people working on it - not all of whom will be of the same level of experience.</p>

"How can I improve the edit-compile-test loop when developing a SharePoint workflow?","<p>Recently I had to develop a SharePoint workflow, and I found the experience quite honestly the most painful programming task I've ever had to tackle. One big problem I had was the problems I encountered when I had to step through it in the debugger.</p>

<p>There's an article on how to debug a SharePoint workflow <a href=""http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/archive/2008/06/11/SharePoint-Debugging-and-Logging-Tips-and-Tricks.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> that tells you how to set breakpoints etc. This involves copying the .pdb file into the GAC alongside the .dll file containing your workflow. You have to do this from a command prompt (or a batch file) because Windows Explorer doesn't let you view the relevant subdirectory of c:\windows\assembly.</p>

<p>However, if you do this, the next time you try to deploy the workflow from within Visual Studio, it complains that it can't be deployed because ""the file may not be signed"" and if you attempt to copy the new version of the dll into the GAC, it tells you that the .dll file is locked.</p>

<p>I've found that some of the time, you can get round this by doing an iisreset, but on other occasions you have to restart Visual Studio and there have been frequent times when I've even had to reboot the computer altogether because some mystery process has locked the file. When I don't use the debugger, on the other hand, everything works just fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that the base class property <code>DropDownItems</code> has a 'default' attribute set on it that is a different value (not 50).  As a result, when I drag the control onto a form, the designer file gets an explicit <code>mycontrol.DropDownItems = 50;</code> line.</p>

But if later I change my inherited class to <code>DropDownItems = 45;</code> in the constructor, this does not affect any of the controls on any form since all those designer files still have the value 50 hard-coded in them.

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize. I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it. As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable. Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines. Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific. I'm after vertical resizing, and the width doesn't matter as much. The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick; it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

"How do I make a GUI?","<p>I've made many different seperate parts of a GUI system for the Nintendo DS, like buttons and textboxes and select boxes, but I need a way of containing these classes in one Gui class, so that I can draw everything to the screen all at once, and check all the buttons at once to check if any are being pressed. My question is what is the best way organize all the classes (such as buttons and textboxes) into one GUI class?</p>

<p>Here's one way I thought of but it doesn't seem right:</p>

"Performing a Stress Test on Web Application?","<p>In the past, I used Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool and Pylot to stress test web applications. I'd written a simple home page, login script, and site walkthrough (in an ecommerce site adding a few items to a cart and checkout).</p>

<p>Just hitting the homepage hard with a handful of developers would almost always locate a major problem. More scalability problems would surface at the second stage, and even more - after the launch.</p>

<p>The URL of the tools I used were Microsoft Homer (aka <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e2c0585a-062a-439e-a67d-75a89aa36495&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""noreferrer"">Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool</a>) and <a href=""https://code.google.com/archive/p/pylt/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pylot</a>.</p>

<p>The reports generated by these tools never made much sense to me, and I would spend many hours trying to figure out what kind of concurrent load the site would be able to support. It was always worth it because the stupidest bugs and bottlenecks would always come up (for instance, web server misconfigurations).</p>

<p>What have you done, what tools have you used, and what success have you had with your approach? The part that is most interesting to me is coming up with some kind of a meaningful formula for calculating the number of concurrent users an app can support from the numbers reported by the stress test application.</p>

"Of Memory Management, Heap Corruption, and C++","<p>So, I need some help. I am working on a project in C++. However, I think I have somehow managed to corrupt my heap. This is based on the fact that I added an <code>std::string</code> to a class and assigning it a value from another <code>std::string</code>:</p>

<pre><code>std::string hello = ""Hello, world.\n"";
/* exampleString = ""Hello, world.\n"" would work fine. */
exampleString = hello;
</code></pre>

<p>crashes on my system with a stack dump. So basically I need to <strong>stop</strong> and go through all my code and memory management stuff and find out where I've screwed up. The codebase is still small (about 1000 lines), so this is easily do-able. </p>

<p>Still, I'm over my head with this kind of stuff, so I thought I'd throw it out there. I'm on a Linux system and have poked around with <code>valgrind</code>, and while not knowing completely what I'm doing, it did report that the <code>std::string</code>'s destructor was an invalid free. I have to admit to getting the term 'Heap Corruption' from a Google search; any general purpose articles on this sort of stuff would be appreciated as well.</p>

<p>(In before <code>rm -rf ProjectDir</code>, do again in C# :D)</p>

<p>EDIT:
I haven't made it clear, but what I'm asking for are ways an advice of diagnosing these sort of memory problems. I know the std::string stuff is right, so it's something I've done (or a bug, but there's Not A Problem With Select). I'm sure I could check the code I've written up and you very smart folks would see the problem in no time, but I want to add this kind of code analysis to my 'toolbox', as it were.</p>

"How to solve the select overlap bug in IE6?","<p>When using IE, you cannot put an absolutely positioned div over a select input element. That's because the select element is considered an ActiveX object and is on top of every HTML element in the page.</p>

<p>I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.</p>

<p>FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect.</p>

<p>Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere.</p>

<p>Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and styling it with:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#MyDiv iframe
{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    filter: mask();
    border: 0;

"Printing from a .NET Service","<p>I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application, formatting the contents of that message, and sending it to a printer.  The technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it <em>seems</em> that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-page printing will be a big headache.</li>
<li>Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)</li>

"Extension interface patterns","<p>The new extensions in .Net 3.5 allow functionality to be split out from interfaces.</p>

<p>For instance in .Net 2.0</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }

    List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can (in 3.5) become:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }
}

public static class HaveChildrenExtension {
    public static List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren( this IHaveChildren ) {
        //logic to get children by parent type and id
        //shared for all classes implementing IHaveChildren 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces.  They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make the code more maintainable and easier to test.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?)</p>

<p>Any other reasons not to regularly use this pattern?</p>

<hr>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Yeah, I see the tendency with extension methods is to end up with them everywhere. I'd be particularly careful having any on .Net value types without a great deal of peer review (I think the only one we have on a string is a <code>.SplitToDictionary()</code> - similar to <code>.Split()</code> but taking a key-value delimiter too)</p>

<p>I think there's a whole best practice debate there ;-)</p>

<p>(Incidentally: DannySmurf, your PM sounds scary.)</p>

<p>I'm specifically asking here about using extension methods where previously we had interface methods.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implementing these models mostly already have base classes. I think this model could be more maintainable and less overly-coupled than adding further object hierarchies.</p>

You want to check for a certain object in the collection, but the collection doesn't have a <code>Contains()</code> method.  There are several ways of dealing with this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement your own <code>Contains()</code> method by looping through all items in the collection to see if one of them is what you are looking for. This seems to be the ""best practice"" approach.</li>
<li>I recently came across some code where instead of a loop, there was an attempt to access the object inside a try statement, as follows:</li>

<li>If I set the rectangle with the PageBreakAtEnd property and the table with the visibility condition, then I still get a page break even when the table isn't shown.</li>

<p><strong>Further Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>This is actually a sort of follow-up to another question I asked, <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3725/best-method-for-creating-a-tree-view-preferences-dialog-type-of-interface-in-c"">Best method for creating a “tree-view preferences dialog” type of interface in C#?</a></em>. The answer I got was great and solved many, many organizational problems I was having in terms of keeping the UI straight and easy to work with both in run-time and design-time. However, it did bring up this one niggling issue of easily controlling other aspects of the interface.</p>

<p>Basically, I have a root form that instantiates a lot of other forms that sit in a panel on the root form. So, for instance, a radio button on one of those sub-forms might need to alter the state of a status strip icon on the main, root form. In that case, I need the sub-form to talk to the control in the status strip of the parent (root) form. (I hope that makes sense, not in a ""who's on first"" kind of way.)</p>

<p>Currently all the available editors we can find have one of the following issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They rely on mshtml.dll or the web browser control which as proven for us to be unreliable as the HTML code and the editor get out of sync under windows 2000  (IE6)</p></li>

"Generic type conversion FROM string","<p>I have a class that I want to use to store ""properties"" for another class. These properties simply have a name and a value. Ideally, what I would like is to be able to add <em>typed</em> properties, so that the ""value"" returned is always of the type that I want it to be.</p>

<p>The type should always be a primitive. This class subclasses an abstract class which basically stores the name and value as string. The idea being that this subclass will add some type-safety to the base class (as well as saving me on some conversion).</p>

<p>So, I have created a class which is (roughly) this:</p>

<pre><code>public class TypedProperty&lt;DataType&gt; : Property
{
    public DataType TypedValue
    {
        get { // Having problems here! }
        set { base.Value = value.ToString();}
    }
}

<p><strong>Is there a ""generic"" way to convert from string back to a primitive?</strong></p>

"Is there some way of recycling a Crystal Reports dataset?","<p>I'm trying to write a Crystal Report which has totals grouped in a different way to the main report. The only way I've been able to do this so far is to use a subreport for the totals, but it means having to hit the data source again to retrieve the same data, which seems like nonsense. Here's a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>       date   name   earnings   source          location
-----------------------------------------------------------
12-AUG-2008   Tom      $50.00   washing cars    uptown

12-AUG-2008   Harry    $75.00   mowing lawns    around town

                    total earnings for washing cars: $150.00 { subreport }
                    total earnings for mowing lawns:  $75.00

       date   name   earnings   source          location
-----------------------------------------------------------
13-AUG-2008   John     $95.00   dog walking     downtown
13-AUG-2008   Jane    $105.00   washing cars    around town  { main report }
13-AUG-2008   Dave     $65.00   mowing lawns    around town

                    total earnings for dog walking:   $95.00
                    total earnings for washing cars: $105.00 { subreport }
                    total earnings for mowing lawns:  $65.00
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the main report is grouped by 'date', but the totals are grouped additionally by 'source'. I've looked up examples of using running totals, but they don't really do what I need. Isn't there some way of storing the result set and having both the main report and the subreport reference the same data?</p>

"Final managed exception handler in a mixed native/managed executable?","<p>I have an MFC application compiled with /clr and I'm trying to implement a final handler for otherwise un-caught managed exceptions. For native exceptions, overriding <code>CWinApp::ProcessWndProcException</code> works.</p>

<p>The two events suggested in Jeff's <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/exception/ExceptionHandling.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CodeProject article</a>,<code>Application.ThreadException</code> and <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException</code>, are not raised.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a way to provide a final managed exception handler for a mixed executable?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>It appears that these exception handlers are only triggered downstream of <code>Application.Run</code> or similar (there's a worker thread flavor, can't remember the name.) If you want to truly globally catch a managed exception you do need to install an SEH filter. You're not going to get a <code>System.Exception</code> and if you want a callstack you're going to have to roll your own walker.</p>

<p>In an MSDN forum question on this topic it was suggested to override a sufficiently low-level point of the main MFC thread in a <code>try ... catch (Exception^)</code>.  For instance, <code>CWinApp::Run</code>.  This may be a good solution but I haven't looked at any perf or stability implications.  You'll get a chance to log with a call stack before you bail and you can avoid the default windows unahndled exception behavior.</p>

<p>Is it simply a case of including a timer across each database call and logging the result, or is there a 'neater' way of doing it?  Maybe there's a framework that does this for you already, or is there a flag I could enable in e.g. Linq-to-SQL that would provide similar functionality.</p>

<p>For example, assuming an easy BPM (beats per minute) of 120, the timer should tick every .5 seconds (or 500 milliseconds).  Using this as the basis for the ticks, however, isn't entirely accurate as .NET only guarantees that your timer will not tick before the elapsed time has passed.</p>

<p>Currently, to get around this for the same 120 BPM example used above, I am setting the ticks to something like 100 milliseconds and only playing the click sound on every 5th timer tick.  This does improve the accuracy quite a bit, but if feels like a bit of a hack.</p>

<li>page flipping animation, ie. pick an item in a list, list scrolls out of view to the left and information for item scrolls in from the right</li>
<li>the animation part would have to work with dynamic pages, ie. not just one big page that has divs set up for each sub-item, which at least one such framework had as a sort of quick fix, I would need to have list item picking load the <em>page</em> for that item, and then when loaded, scroll to it</li>

<p>I'm setting up a new hosting solution and would much prefer to run a 64bit OS, and since it's an ASP.Net MVC solution with SQL Server DB, the OS is either going to be Windows Server 2003 or (hopefully!) 2008.</p>

<p>I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some <a href=""https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mscom/2005/09/26/running-microsoft-com-on-64-bitthe-dependencies-the-goodness-the-gotchas/"" rel=""noreferrer"">very</a> <a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/64-bit-desktop-vs-64-bit-server/"" rel=""noreferrer"">good</a> reasons.</p>

<p>So far, I've tried a number of options and found a <a href=""http://blog.rakeshxp.com/2007/09/running-memcached-on-windows.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">bit</a> of <a href=""http://www.splinedancer.com/memcached-win32/"" rel=""noreferrer"">help</a> related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original <a href=""http://jehiah.cz/projects/memcached-win32/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Windows port</a> is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the <a href=""https://libevent.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">libevent</a> for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version.</p>

<p>I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting ""compile"" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is working on getting this off the ground? Unfortunately, my expertise lie in managed code (C#) only, otherwise I would try and take this on myself, but I can't believe I'm the only guy out there trying to get <a href=""https://memcached.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">memcached</a> running on a 64 bit Windows server....am I?</p>

<p>Update</p>

<p><strong>Yes I'm afraid I'm still looking for an answer to this - all my efforts (with my pathetic C++ skills) to make a stable build have failed - I've trashed one server and 3 VM's just trying it out so now I turn to the real experts.
Is anyone planning on porting this to 64bit? Or are you really suggesting that I use MS Velocity instead? I shudder at the thought.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.</p>

<p>@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>

<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't ""trust"" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide ""Enterprise Level"" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down. Oh well... till next time.</p>

"ActionScript 3.0 sockets can't reconnect","<p>I'm having trouble connecting (via the Socket and XMLSocket classes) to a TCP listener after a connect timeout.</p>

<p>I have a flash applet that needs to maintain a TCP connection to a server. I have implemented timeouts using Timers, a ping-pong system, etc. However, there's a problem. Upon calling Socket.connect(), the flash player (9.0.115 and many other stables before that) sends 3 connection requests by way of SYN packets, with some time in between. If none of those are replied to (e.g. because the server is down), I cannot get the applet to [attempt to] connect to the server. Ever. That is, within the lifetime of the applet.</p>

<p>To clarify and/or summarize:</p>

<p>For any host/port pair given to Socket.connect() or XMLSocket.connect(), if the call fails, any subsequent connect() calls to any other Socket (or XMLSocket) instances <strong>within the lifetime of the Flash applet</strong> to the same host/port pair get ignored. (At least as far as I can tell using a packet sniffer.)</p>

<p>I have tried calling numerous Socket methods, destroying¹ and recreating the objects, using a pool of Sockets, and various other methods I can't remember right now; all to no avail.</p>

<p>My current solution is to notify the parent webpage through a JavaScript call and let it reload my applet. It's not a pretty solution, and I'm not about to implement workarounds for the problems <em>it</em> causes, just because Flash can't handle socket connections properly.</p>

<p>I must be missing something very simple.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>1: I know you can't really destroy objects; I just remove all references to them and hope for the best. I haven't tried to explicitly invoke the GC in this case. (Though I think I did try putting the Socket inside an Array and using <em>delete</em>.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, it works as expected if the connection is successful (even if the connection drops later on.)</p>

<p>The only event to trigger this is the case when the server doesn't respond at all; it's as if Flash marks the host/port combination as ""offline"" and doesn't bother sending any more packets to it for the lifetime of the applet.</p>

<p>I suspect an active refusal of the connection (e.g. host is online but not listening to the port) doesn't cause this.</p>

<p>I get no error message or feedback of any other kind from the Socket.</p>

<p>Have you ever called connect() more than once to the same host/port pair, when the first one failed?
How did you know the first connect() failed? And before subsequent connect() calls, did you do anything to reset the socket?</p>

"Generic type checking","<p><strong>Is there a way to enforce/limit the types that are passed to primitives?</strong> <em>(bool, int, string, etc.)</em></p>
<p>Now, I know you can limit the generic type parameter to a type or interface implementation via the <em>where</em> clause. However, this doesn't fit the bill for primitives (AFAIK) because they do not all have a common ground (apart from <em>object</em> before someone says! :P).</p>
<p>So, my current thoughts are to just grit my teeth and do a big <em>switch</em> statement and throw an <em>ArgumentException</em> on failure.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong></p>
<p>Just to clarify:</p>
<p>The code definition should be like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass&lt;GenericType&gt; ....
</code></pre>
<p>And instantiation:</p>
<pre><code>MyClass&lt;bool&gt; = new MyClass&lt;bool&gt;(); // Legal
MyClass&lt;string&gt; = new MyClass&lt;string&gt;(); // Legal
MyClass&lt;DataSet&gt; = new MyClass&lt;DataSet&gt;(); // Illegal
MyClass&lt;RobsFunkyHat&gt; = new MyClass&lt;RobsFunkyHat&gt;(); // Illegal (but looks awesome!)
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>
<p>@Jon Limjap - Good point, and something I was already considering. I'm sure there is a generic method that can be used to determine if the type is of a value or reference type.</p>
<p>This could be useful in instantly removing a lot of the objects I don't want to deal with (but then you need to worry about the structs that are used such as <em>Size</em> ). Interesting problem no? :)</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

<hr />
<p>I'm curious. Could this be done in .NET 3.x using extension methods? Create an interface, and implement the interface in the extension methods (which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch). Plus if you then need to later extend to any lightweight custom types, they can also implement the same interface, with no changes required to the base code.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>The sad news is I am working in Framework 2!! :D</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>
<p>This was so simple following on from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8941/generic-type-checking#8956"">Jon Limjaps Pointer</a>.. So simple I almost want to cry, but it's great because the code works like a charm!</p>
<p>So here is what I did (you'll laugh!):</p>
<h2>Code added to the generic class</h2>
<pre><code>bool TypeValid()
{
    // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type
    TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType));

    // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types
    // with the exception of Object and Empty (Null).
    // Since I am willing to allow Null Types (at this time)
    // all we need to check for is Object!
    switch (code)
    {
        case TypeCode.Object:
            return false;
        default:
            return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception,</p>
<pre><code>private void EnforcePrimitiveType()
{
    if (!TypeValid())
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            &quot;Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '&quot; + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + 
            &quot;' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>All that then needs to be done is to call <em>EnforcePrimitiveType()</em> in the classes constructors. Job done! :-)</p>
<p>The only downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FxCop</a> (which we don't use at work).</p>

"Calling Table-Valued SQL Functions From .NET","<p>Scalar-valued functions can be called from .NET as follows:</p>

SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
adapter.Fill(tbl);

"Can I specify a class wide group on a TestNG test case?","<p>I have a base class that represents a database test in TestNG, and I want to specify that all classes extending from this class are of a group ""db-test"", however I have found that this doesn't seem possible.  I have tried the @Test annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@Test(groups = { ""db-test"" })
public class DBTestBase {
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't work because the @Test annotation will try to make a bunch of methods into tests, and warnings/errors pop up in eclipse when the tests are run.</p>

<p>So I tried disabling the test, so at least the groups are assigned:</p>

<pre><code>@Test(enabled = false, groups = { ""db-test"" })
public class DBTestBase {
}
</code></pre>

<p>but then any @BeforeTest (and other similar annotations) ALSO get disabled... which is of course not what I want.</p>

"Lingering assembly dependency in C# .NET","<p>My C# project - we'll call it the SuperUI - used to make use of a class from an external assembly. Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the <code>SuperException</code> - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, <code>SuperAssembly.DLL</code>, which I referenced.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all <code>SuperExceptions</code> with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.</p>

<p>Now, here's the thing:</p>

<ol>
<li>All uses of <code>SuperException</code> have been eliminated from the project's code.</li>
<li>Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, I only reference one more assembly - and <code>that</code> references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw <code>SuperExceptions</code>, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!</li>
<li>I've done Visual Studio's ""Clean Solution"" and cleared everything out by hand, many times.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's not the end of the world to include this reference, I just don't see why it's necessary any more. Nrrrgg. Any pointers welcome!</p>

"How to obtain good concurrent read performance from disk","<p>I'd like to ask a question then follow it up with my own answer, but also see what answers other people have.</p>

<p>We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.</p>

<p>Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.</p>

<p>If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?</strong>  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<p>The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.</p>

<p>We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.</p>

<p>Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.</p>

<p>The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.</p>

"Interfaces on different logic layers","<p>Say you have an application divided into 3-tiers: GUI, business logic, and data access. In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>

<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>

<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. </p>

<p>Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.</p>

<p>I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers? </p>

<p>In fact, the hidden private field does not even show up in the debugger, which is OK given the fact that the get/set functions do nothing. But when I want to actually implement some getter/setter logic, I have to use the private/public pair anyway.</p>

<p>I see the benefit that I save a lot of code (one vs six lines) without losing the ability to change the getter/setter logic later, but then again I can already do that by simply declaring a public field ""Public string Title"" without the need of the { get; set; } block, thus even saving more code.</p>

"Running Javascript after control's selected value has been set","<p>Simple ASP.NET application.</p>

<p>I have two drop-down controls. On the first-drop down I have a JavaScript <code>onChange</code> event. The JavaScript enables the second drop-down and removes a value from it (the value selected in the first drop-down). If they click the blank first value of the drop-down, then the second drop-down will be disabled (and the options reset).</p>

<p>I also have code in the <code>OnPreRender</code> method that will enable or disable the second drop-down based on the value of the first drop-down. This is so that the value of the first drop-down can be selected in code (loading user settings).</p>

<p>My problem is:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user selects something in the first drop-down. The second drop-down will become enabled through JavaScript. </li>
<li>They then change a third drop-down that initiates a post back. After the post back the drop-downs are in the correct state (first value selected, second drop-down enabled).</li>
<li>If they then click the back button, the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there's something selected in the first drop-down.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried adding a startup script (that will set the correct state of the second-drop down) through <code>ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript</code>, however when this gets called the first drop-down has a <code>selectedIndex</code> of <code>0</code>, not what it actually is. My guess is that the value of the selection gets set after my start script (but still doesn't call the <code>onChange</code> script).</p>

"Replicating load related crashes in non-production environments","<p>We're running a custom application on our intranet and we have found a problem after upgrading it recently where IIS hangs with 100% CPU usage, requiring a reset.</p>

<p>Rather than subject users to the hangs, we've rolled back to the previous release while we determine a solution.  The first step is to reproduce the problem -- but we can't. </p>

<p>Here's some background:</p>

<p>Prod has a single virtualized (vmware) web server with two CPUs and 2 GB of RAM.  The database server has 4GB, and 2 CPUs as well.  It's also on VMWare, but separate physical hardware.</p>

<p>During normal usage the application runs fine.  The w3wp.exe process normally uses betwen 5-20% CPU and around 200MB of RAM.  CPU and RAM fluctuate slightly under normal use, but nothing unusual.</p>

<p>However, when we start running into problems, the RAM climbs dramatically and the CPU pegs at 98% (or as much as it can get).  The site becomes unresponsive, necessitating a IIS restart.  Resetting the app pool does nothing in this situation, a full IIS restart is required.</p>

<p>It does not happen during the night (no usage).  It happens more when the site is under load, but it has also happened under non-peak periods.</p>

<p>First step to solving this problem is reproducing it. To simulate the load, we starting using JMeter to simulate usage. Our load script is based on actual usage around the time of the crash.  Using JMeter, we can ramp the usage up quite high (2-3 times the load during the crash) but the site behaves fine.  CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any tips on how to reproduce a problem like this in a non-production environment?  We'd really like to reproduce the error, determine a solution, then test again to make sure we've resolved it.  During the process we've found a number of small things that we've improved that might solve the problem, but I'd really feel a lot more confident if we could reproduce the problem and test the improved version.</p>

New assemblies are now built using VS2008 and targetting .NET 2.0, we know that works ok. However we'd like to start taking advantage of C# 3.0 language features such as LINQ and targetting the assemblies against .NET 3.5 without having to build and deploy a new version of the windows service.</p>

"Displaying vector graphics in a browser","<p>I need to display some interactive (attaching with DOM listeners etc. and event handling) vector graphics in web site I am working on. There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - <a href=""http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""excanvas"">excanvas</a>, <a href=""http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-programmatic-dijit-and-dojo/drawing-gfx"" rel=""noreferrer"">GFX of Dojo Toolkit</a> and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.</p>

<p>So the question actually consists of several parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?</li>
<li>If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter:</p>

<ul>
<li>The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc.</li>
<li>The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7.</li>
<li>Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes.</li>
<li>I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library <a href=""http://www.degrafa.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Degrafa</a>. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<strong>EDIT 2</strong>] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by ""Windows lock-in"" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one <em>is able to</em> launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user.</p>

"Playing wave file ends immediately (C++, Windows)","<p>I have got the following situation. On a machine there is a <strong>Fritz ISDN</strong> card. There is a process that is responsible for playing a certain wave file on this device's wave out (<strong>ISDN</strong> connection is made at startup and made persistent). The scenario is easy, whenever needed the process calls <code>waveOutWrite()</code> on the previously opened wave device (everything initialized without any problems of course) and a callback function waits for <code>MM_WOM_DONE</code> msg to know that the playback has been finished. </p>

<p>Since a few days however (nothing changed neither in the process nor the machine) the <code>MM_WOM_DONE</code> message has been coming immediately after calling <code>waveOutWrite()</code> even though the wave lasts a couple of seconds. Again no error is reported, it looks like the file was played but had zero length (which is not the case). I am also sure that <code>waveOutReset()</code> was not called by my process (it would also trigger sending the mentioned message). I have already used to have some strange problems in the past that where solved simply by reinstalling <strong>TAPI</strong> drivers. This time for some reason it is problematic for me to perform that once again and I am trying more analytical approach :). Any suggestions what might cause such a behavior?

There is no design documentation, and comments are sparse.  It's a mess, and it seems that whenever we try to refactor the code or add new functionality, we introduce deadlocks or other problems.</p>

"What is the easiest way to add compression to WCF in Silverlight?","<p>I have a silverlight 2 beta 2 application that accesses a WCF web service.  Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding.  The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data.  This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 (I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it.).  </p>

<p>The request does have the ""Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response?</p>

<p>I did find this <a href=""http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/113763-wcf-client-j2ee-server-using-gzip.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a> but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO.</p>

<p>OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never ""seem"" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work.  Well, as it turns out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dynamic Compression on IIS7 <strong>was</strong> working al along.  It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working.  My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it ""under the covers"" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response.  I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.  In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!</p></li>
<li><p>The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all.</p>

"Whats the best way of finding ALL your memory when developing on the Compact Framework?","<p>I've used the CF <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/stevenpr/archive/2006/04/17/577636.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Remote Performance Monitor</a>, however this seems to only track memory initialised in the managed world as opposed to the unmanaged world. Well, I can only presume this as the numbers listed in the profiler are way short of the maximum allowed (32mb on CE 5). Profiling a particular app with the RPM showed me that the total usage of all the caches only manages to get to about 12mb and then slowly shrinks as (I assume) something unmanaged starts to claim more memory.
The memory slider in System also shows that the device is very short on memory. If I kill the process the slider shows all the memory coming back. So it must (?) be this managed process that is swallowing the memory.</p>

<p>Is there any simple(ish?) fashion how one can track unmanaged memory usage in some way that might enable me to match it up with the corresponding P/Invoke calls?</p>

"Why doesn't Ruby have a real StringBuffer or StringIO?","<p>I recently read a nice <a href=""http://macdevelopertips.com/ruby/using-a-string-as-a-file-in-ruby.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">post</a> on using <code>StringIO</code> in Ruby.  What the author doesn't mention, though, is that <code>StringIO</code> is just an ""I.""  There's no ""O.""  You <em>can't</em> do this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>s = StringIO.new
s &lt;&lt; 'foo'
s &lt;&lt; 'bar'
s.to_s
# =&gt; should be ""foo\nbar""
# =&gt; really is ''`
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>

<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>

<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If <code>stuff</code> is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.</p>

<pre><code>result = stuff.map(&amp;:to_s).join(' ')
</code></pre>

<p>The ""correct"" way to do this in Java is:</p>

<pre><code>result = StringBuffer.new("""")

  result.append(s);

"Small modification to an XML document using StAX","<p>I'm currently trying to read in an XML file, make some minor changes (alter the value of some attributes), and write it back out again.</p>

<p>I have intended to use a StAX parser (<code>javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader</code>) to read in each event, see if it was one I wanted to change, and then pass it straight on to the StAX writer (<code>javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader</code>) if no changes were required.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that doesn't look to be so simple - The writer has no way to take an event type and a parser object, only methods like <code>writeAttribute</code> and <code>writeStartElement</code>.

"Asynchronous Remoting calls","<p>We have a remoting singleton server running in a separate windows service (let's call her RemotingService). The clients of the RemotingService are ASP.NET instances (many many).</p>

<p>Currently, the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced. However, the remoting service is getting complicated enough (with more RPC calls and complex algorithms) that the asp.net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time (4-5 seconds).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164128.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this msdn article</a>, doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC.

  is to free up an ASP.NET thread pool
  thread to service additional requests

"What is the difference between integration and unit tests?","<p>I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a <code>Word</code> class, I will write some unit tests for the <code>Word</code> class.  Then, I begin writing my <code>Sentence</code> class, and when it needs to interact with the <code>Word</code> class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both <code>Sentence</code> and <code>Word</code>... at least in the places where they interact.</p>

<p><em>Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?</em></p>

"Ruby mixins and calling super methods","<p>Ok, so I've been refactoring my code in my little Rails app in an effort to remove duplication, and in general make my life easier (as I like an easy life).  Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around.  The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document.  So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO).</p>

<p>The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the <strong>after_initialize</strong> hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins.</p>

<p>The problem I have, is that I can have an <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a <strong>super</strong> call at the start to make sure the other mixin <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> calls get called.  Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call.</p>

<p>Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough:</p>

<pre><code>class Iso &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by                :customer
  order_lines             :despatched # Mixin

  tracks_serial_numbers   :items  # Mixin

  sendable :customer                      # Mixin

  attr_accessor :address

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So, if each one of the mixins have an after_initialize call, with a <strong>super</strong> call, how can I stop that last <strong>super</strong> call from raising the error? How can I test that the super method exists before I call it?</p>

"Data Layer Best Practices","<p>I am in the middle of a ""discussion"" with a colleague about the best way to implement the data layer in a new application.</p>

<p>One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively.  </p>

<p>The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.)</p>

<p>I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.</p>

<p>My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  </p>

<p>Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.  </p>

"How can I ""unaccept"" a drag in Flex?","<p>Once I've called <code>DragManager.acceptDrag</code> is there any way to ""unaccept"" the drag? Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</p>

<p>This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</p>

<pre><code>DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
</code></pre>

<p>In browser-based Flex, <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running <em>exactly the same code</em> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</p>

It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.</p>

<p>I'll add to the list below as people reply, I apologise if I duplicate any entries.</p>

<p><strong>Pros I have so far</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Minimal money requirement (they already have a computer)</li>
<li>Will help them to think in new ways</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Great challenge, every day really is a fresh challenge in some way, shape or form. Not many jobs can truly offer that.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) I like the way it makes me think.. I look at EVERYTHING more logically as my skills improve.. This helps with general living as well as programming.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Money is/can be pretty good.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Its a pretty portable trade.. With collaboration tech as it is, you can pretty much work anywhere in the world so long as you have an Internet connection.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) It's an exciting industry to work in, theres massive amounts of tech to work and play with!</li>
<li>(Quarrelsome) Jetpacks. Programming is Technology and the more time we spend with technology the closer we get to having Jetpacks. (<em>Teifion: This is a really cool analogy!</em>)</li>
<li>(Saj) Profitable way of Exercising Brain Muscles.</li>
<li>(Saj) It makes you look brilliant to some audience.</li>
<li>(Saj) Makes you tech-smart.</li>
<li>(Saj) Makes you eligible to the future world.</li>
<li>(Saj) It's easy, fun, not in a math way..</li>
<li>(kiwiBastard) If the person likes problem solving then programming is no better example.</li>
<li>(kiwiBastard) Brilliant sense of achivement when you can interact with something you have designed and coded</li>
<li>(kiwiBastard) Great way to meet chicks/chaps - erm, maybe not that one (<em>Teifion: I dunno where you do programming but I want to come visit some time</em>)</li>
<li>(epatel) Learning how to program is like learning spell casting at Hogwarts . The computer will be your servant forever...</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cons I have so far</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Can be frustrating when it's not working</li>
<li>Not physical exercise</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) There are a lot of people doing it just for the money. They have no love for the craft and just appear lazy, annoying and sometimes it can really grind my gears seeing an industry and workforce I enjoy so much being diluted with crap. Which can often reflect badly on all of us.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Not so sure about the initial cost.. Yeah you can get started with Java or something at low cost, but for me, locally, the vast demand is for .NET developers, which can be costly getting up and running with. However, this is rapidly/has not becoming the case with the amount of work put in by MS with releasing pretty damn good Express editions of their main development product line.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Its a lifelong career.. I truly feel you never really become a ""master"" by nature of the industry, you stop for 1-2 years. You're behind the times.. Some people do not like the pace.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Some geeks can be hard to work with.. While I think the general geek movement is really changing for the better, you will always have the classic ""I am more intelligent than you"" geeks that can really just be a pain in the ass for all!</li>
<li>(Saj) Can cause virtual damage.</li>

"Future proofing a large UI Application - MFC with 2008 Feature pack, or C# and Winforms?","<p>My company has developed a long standing product using MFC in Visual C++ as the defacto standard for UI development. Our codebase contains ALOT of legacy/archaic code which must be kept operational. Some of this code is older than me (originally written in the late 70s) and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6.</p>

<p>However, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors', and that something needs to be done.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out 'new' technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.</p>

<p>I have been using C# with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI won't require much interop with the legacy C++ codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.</p>

<p>The alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...</p>

<p>So, which do I pick? We're a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development - I want to get it right.</p>

<p>Is MFC dead? Is C#/Winforms the way forward? Is there anything else I'm totally missing? Help greatly appreciated!</p>

"Best way to model Many-To-One Relationships in NHibernate When Dealing With a Legacy DB?","<p>Warning - I am very new to NHibernate. I know this question seems simple - and I'm sure there's a simple answer, but I've been spinning my wheels for some time on this one. I am dealing with a legacy db which really can't be altered structurally. I have a details table which lists payment plans that have been accepted by a customer. Each payment plan has an ID which links back to a reference table to get the plan's terms, conditions, etc. In my object model, I have an AcceptedPlan class, and a Plan class. Originally, I used a many-to-one relationship from the detail table back to the ref table to model this relationship in NHibernate. I also created a one-to-many relationship going in the opposite direction from the Plan class over to the AcceptedPlan class. This was fine while I was simply reading data. I could go to my Plan object, which was a property of my AcceptedPlan class to read the plan's details. My problem arose when I had to start inserting new rows to the details table. From my reading, it seems the only way to create a new child object is to add it to the parent object and then save the session. But I don't want to have to create a new parent Plan object every time I want to create a new detail record. This seems like unnecessary overhead. Does anyone know if I am going about this in the wrong way?</p>

"Unit tests for deep cloning","<p>Let's say I have a complex .NET class, with lots of arrays and other class object members.  I need to be able to generate a deep clone of this object - so I write a Clone() method, and implement it with a simple BinaryFormatter serialize/deserialize - or perhaps I do the deep clone using some other technique which is more error prone and I'd like to make sure is tested.</p>

<p>OK, so now (ok, I should have done it first) I'd like write tests which cover the cloning.  All the members of the class are private, and my architecture is so good (!) that I haven't needed to write hundreds of public properties or other accessors.

<p>What approaches do people take to testing that the cloned object is a good copy?   Do you write (or <em>rewrite</em> once you discover the need for the clone) all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with <em>either</em> a 'virgin' object <em>or</em> with a clone of it?   How would you test if part of the cloning wasn't deep enough - as this is just the kind of problem which can give hideous-to-find bugs later?</p>

When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.

"How do I create a workflow instance reliably based on an external event?","<p>a little new to the windows workflow stuff so go easy :)</p>

<p>I wish to design a workflow host environment that has high availability - a minimum of 2 WF runtime hosts on separate hardware both pointing to the same persistance or tracking SQL database.</p>

<p>I am looking for a pattern whereby I can asynchronously create new workflow instances based on some external event (i.e. some piece of data is updated in DB by a different application). For each event I need to create exactly one workflow instance and doesn't matter which host that instance is created on. There is also some flexibility regarding the duration of time between the event and when the workflow instance is actually created.</p>

<p>One solution I am considering is having a WCF interface on the WF hosts and placing them behind some sort of load balancer. It would then be up to whatever part of the system that is firing the ""event"" to make the WCF call.</p>

<p>I'm not really happy with this because if both\all WF hosts are down, or otherwise unavailable, the event could be ""lost"". Also, I won't be able manage load the way I would like to. I envisage a situation where there may be lots of events in a small period of time, but it's perfectly acceptable to handle those events some time later.</p>

<p>So I reckon I need to persist the events somehow and decouple the event creation from the event handling.</p>

<p>Is putting these events into MSMQ, or a simple event table in SQL Server, and having the WF host just poll the queue periodically a viable solution? Polling seems to be a such a dirty word though...</p>

<p>Would NServiceBus and durable messaging be useful here?</p>

<p>Any insights would be much appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong></p>

<p>The database will be clustered with shared fiber channel storage. The network will also be redundant. In order for WF runtime instances to have fail-over they must point at a common persistence service, which in this case is a SQL backend. It's high availability, not Total Availabilty :)</p>

<p>It appears as though some of the XPath processor libraries won't recognize <code>//foo</code> because of the namespace whereas others will. The option my team has thought about is to add a namespace prefix using regular expressions to the XPath (you can add a namespace prefix via XmlNameTable) but this seems brittle since XPath is such a flexible language when it comes to node tests.</p>

<p>Is there a standard that applies to this?</p>

<p>My approach is a bit hackish but it seems to work fine; I remove the <code>xmlns</code> declaration with a search/replace and then apply XPath.</p>

<pre><code>string readyForXpath = Regex.Replace(xmldocument, ""xmlns=\"".+\"""", String.Empty );

<p>Is that a fair approach or has anyone solved this differently?</p>

"What is good server performance monitoring software for Windows?","<p>I'm looking for some software to monitor a single server for performance alerts. Preferably free and with a reasonable default configuration.</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, I would like to run this software on a Windows machine and monitor a remote Windows server for CPU/memory/etc. usage alerts (not a single application).</p>

<p>Edit: I suppose its not necessary that this software be run remotely, I would also settle for something that ran on the server and emailed me if there was an alert. It seems like Windows performance logs and alerts might be used for this purpose somehow but it was not immediately obvious to me.</p>

"Making human readable representations of an Integer","<p>Here's a coding problem for those that like this kind of thing. Let's see your implementations (in your language of choice, of course) of a function which returns a human readable String representation of a specified Integer. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>humanReadable(1) returns ""one"".
<li>humanReadable(53) returns ""fifty-three"".
<li>humanReadable(723603) returns ""seven hundred and twenty-three thousand, six hundred and three"".
<li>humanReadable(1456376562) returns ""one billion, four hundred and fifty-six million, three hundred and seventy-six thousand, five hundred and sixty-two"".
</ul>

"How can I improve performance when adding InDesign XMLElements via AppleScript?","<p>I have an AppleScript program which creates XML tags and elements within an Adobe InDesign document.

<p>I can post the inner loop code, but I'm not sure if SO is supposed to be generic or specific. I'll let the mob decide.</p>

<p>[edit]
The code builds a list (prior to this loop) which contains one item per row in the table. There is also a list containing one string for each column in the table. For each cell, the program creates an XML element and an XML tag by concatenating the items in the [row]/[column] positions of the two lists. It also associates the text in that cell to the newly-created element.</p>

Since many hosting companies offer a single database with their hosting plans (with additional databases costing extra) it is very useful for your users when your database objects (tables, views, constraints, and stored procedures) have a common prefix.

"How do you impersonate an Active Directory user in Powershell?","<p>I'm trying to run powershell commands through a web interface (ASP.NET/C#) in order to create mailboxes/etc on Exchange 2007. When I run the page using Visual Studio (Cassini), the page loads up correctly. However, when I run it on IIS (v5.1), I get the error ""unknown user name or bad password"". The biggest problem that I noticed was that Powershell was logged in as ASPNET instead of my Active Directory Account. How do I force my Powershell session to be authenticated with another Active Directory Account?</p>

"How much extra overhead is generated when sending a file over a web service as a byte array?","<p>This <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11782/file-uploads-via-web-services"">question and answer</a> shows how to send a file as a byte array through an XML web service. How much overhead is generated by using this method for file transfer?  I assume the data looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;bytes&gt;
    &lt;byte&gt;16&lt;/byte&gt;

"Inheritance and Polymorphism - Ease of use vs Purity","<p>In a project our team is using object lists to perform mass operations on sets of data that should all be processed in a similar way.  In particular, different objects would ideally act the same, which would be very easily achieved with polymorphism.  The problem I have with it is that inheritance implies the <em>is a</em> relationship, rather than the <em>has a</em> relationship.  For example, several objects <em>have a</em> damage counter, but to make this easy to use in an object list, polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an <em>is a</em> relationship which wouldn't be true.  (A person <em>is not a</em> damage counter.)</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of is to have a member of the class return the proper object type when implicitly casted instead of relying on inheritance.  Would it be better to forgo the <em>is a</em> / <em>has a</em> ideal in exchange for ease of programming?</p>

<p>Edit:
To be more specific, I am using C++, so using polymorphism would allow the different objects to ""act the same"" in the sense that the derived classes could reside within a single list and be operated upon by a virtual function of the base class.  The use of an interface (or imitating them via inheritance) seems like a solution I would be willing to use.</p>

"Windows Forms Threading and Events - ListBox updates promptly but progressbar experiences huge delay","<p>Our team is creating a new recruitment workflow system to replace an old one. I have been tasked with migrating the old data into the new schema. I have decided to do this by creating a small Windows Forms project as the schema are radically different and straight TSQL scripts are not an adequate solution.</p>

<p>The main sealed class 'ImportController' that does the work declares the following delegate event:</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void ImportProgressEventHandler(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e);
public static event ImportProgressEventHandler importProgressEvent;

<p>The main window starts a static method in that class using a new thread:</p>

<pre><code>Thread dataProcessingThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(ImportController.ImportData));
dataProcessingThread.Name = ""Data Importer: Data Processing Thread"";
dataProcessingThread.Start(settings);
</code></pre>

<p>the ImportProgressEvent args carries a string message, a max int value for the progress bar and an current progress int value. The Windows form subcribes to the event:</p>

<pre><code>ImportController.importProgressEvent += new ImportController.ImportProgressEventHandler(ImportController_importProgressEvent);
</code></pre>

<p>And responds to the event in this manner using it's own delegate:</p>

<pre><code>    private delegate void TaskCompletedUIDelegate(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax);

private void ImportController_importProgressEvent(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e)
            {
                this.Invoke(new TaskCompletedUIDelegate(this.DisplayCompletedTask), e.CompletedTask, e.CurrentProgress, e.ProgressMax);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally the progress bar and listbox are updated:</p>

<pre><code>private void DisplayCompletedTask(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax)
        {
            string[] items = completedTask.Split(new string[] { Environment.NewLine }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

            foreach (string item in items)
            {
                this.lstTasks.Items.Add(item);
            }

"Application configuration files","<p>OK, so I don't want to start a holy-war here, but we're in the process of trying to consolidate the way we handle our application configuration files and we're struggling to make a decision on the best approach to take. At the moment, every application we distribute is using it's own ad-hoc configuration files, whether it's property files (ini style), XML or JSON (internal use only at the moment!).</p>

<p>Most of our code is Java at the moment, so we've been looking at <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/configuration/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apache Commons Config</a>, but we've found it to be quite verbose. We've also looked at <a href=""http://xmlbeans.apache.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">XMLBeans</a>, but it seems like a lot of faffing around. I also feel as though I'm being pushed towards XML as a format, but my clients and colleagues are apprehensive about trying something else. I can understand it from the client's perspective, everybody's heard of XML, but at the end of the day, shouldn't be using the right tool for the job?</p>

"Has anyone had any success in unit testing SQL stored procedures?","<p>We’ve found that the unit tests we’ve written for our C#/C++ code have really paid off. 
But we still have thousands of lines of business logic in stored procedures, which only really get tested in anger when our product is rolled out to a large number of users. </p>

<p>What makes this worse is that some of these stored procedures end up being very long, because of the performance hit when passing temporary tables between SPs. This has prevented us from refactoring to make the code simpler.</p>

<p>We have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures (primarily testing the performance), but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard. For example, we end up copying around test databases. In addition to this, the tests end up being really sensitive to change, and even the smallest change to a stored proc. or table requires a large amount of changes to the tests. So after many builds breaking due to these database tests failing intermittently, we’ve just had to pull them out of the build process.</p>

<p>So, the main part of my questions is: has anyone ever successfully written unit tests for their stored procedures?</p>

<p>The second part of my questions is whether unit testing would be/is easier with linq? </p>

<p>I was thinking that rather than having to set up tables of test data, you could simply create a collection of test objects, and test your linq code in a “linq to objects” situation? (I am a totally new to linq so don’t know if this would even work at all)</p>

"Expression Evaluation and Tree Walking using polymorphism? (ala Steve Yegge)","<p>This morning, I was reading <a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/when-polymorphism-fails"" rel=""noreferrer"">Steve Yegge's: When Polymorphism Fails</a>, when I came across a question that a co-worker of his used to ask potential employees when they came for their interview at Amazon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an example of polymorphism in
  action, let's look at the classic
  ""eval"" interview question, which (as
  far as I know) was brought to Amazon
  by Ron Braunstein. The question is
  quite a rich one, as it manages to
  probe a wide variety of important
  skills: OOP design, recursion, binary
  trees, polymorphism and runtime
  typing, general coding skills, and (if
  you want to make it extra hard)
  parsing theory.</p>
  
  <p>At some point, the candidate hopefully
  realizes that you can represent an
  arithmetic expression as a binary
  tree, assuming you're only using
  binary operators such as ""+"", ""-"",
  ""*"", ""/"". The leaf nodes are all
  numbers, and the internal nodes are
  all operators. Evaluating the
  expression means walking the tree. If
  the candidate doesn't realize this,
  you can gently lead them to it, or if
  necessary, just tell them.</p>
  
  <p>Even if you tell them, it's still an
  interesting problem.</p>
  
  <p>The first half of the question, which
  some people (whose names I will
  protect to my dying breath, but their
  initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a
  Job Requirement If You Want To Call
  Yourself A Developer And Work At
  Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The
  question is: how do you go from an
  arithmetic expression (e.g. in a
  string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an
  expression tree. We may have an ADJ
  challenge on this question at some
  point.</p>
  
  <p>The second half is: let's say this is
  a 2-person project, and your partner,
  who we'll call ""Willie"", is
  responsible for transforming the
  string expression into a tree. You get
  the easy part: you need to decide what
  classes Willie is to construct the
  tree with. You can do it in any
  language, but make sure you pick one,
  or Willie will hand you assembly
  language. If he's feeling ornery, it
  will be for a processor that is no
  longer manufactured in production.</p>
  
  <p>You'd be amazed at how many candidates
  boff this one.</p>
  
  <p>I won't give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. I
  encourage you to work through it
  sometime. Fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  </p>

<p>I've drawn up most of the plans but am having a hard time figuring out a way to handle the auditing system.</p>

<p>Since it is being used internally only and you won't even be able to touch the db from outside the building we are not using a login system as the program will only be used once a user has already logged in to our internal network via Active Directory.  Knowing this, we're using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9052/is-there-a-way-for-ms-access-to-grab-the-current-active-directory-user"">a system to detect automatically the name of the Active Directory user</a> and with their permissions in one of the DB tables, deciding what they can or cannot do.</p>

<p>So the actual audit table will have 3 columns (this design may change but for this question it doesn't matter); who (Active Directory User), when (time of addition/deletion/edit), what (what was changed)</p>

<p>My question is how should I be handling this.  Ideally I know I should be using a trigger so that it is impossible for the database to be updated without an audit being logged, however I don't know how I could grab the Active Directory User that way.  An alternate would be to code it directly into the Access source so that whenever something changes I run an INSERT statement.  Obviously that is flawed because if something happens to Access or the database is touched by something else then it will not log the audit.</p>

Nice and easy but you do not get any notification that the asynchronous upload has completed, and the <code>UploadProgressChanged</code> event doesnt get called back with anything useful.

<p><strong>HttpWebRequest</strong><br>
Bit more complicated but still does what is needed, problem I am getting is that even though it is called on a background thread (supposedly), it still seems to be blocking my UI and the whole browser until the upload has completed which doesnt seem quite right.</p>

<p>Normal .net does have some appropriate <code>WebClient</code> methods for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.onuploaddatacompleted.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OnUploadDataCompleted</a> and progress but these arent available in Silverlight .net ... big omission I think!</p>

<p>Does anyone have any solutions, I need to upload multiple binary files preferrably with a progress but I need to perform some actions when the files have completed their upload.</p>

"Variable parameter/result binding with prepared statements","<p>In a project that I'm about to wrap up, I've written and implemented an object-relational mapping solution for PHP. Before the doubters and dreamers cry out ""how on earth?"", relax -- I haven't found a way to make late static binding work -- I'm just working around it in the best way that I possibly can.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not currently using prepared statements for querying, because I couldn't come up with a way to pass a variable number of arguments to the <code>bind_params()</code> or <code>bind_result()</code> methods. </p>

<p>Why do I need to support a variable number of arguments, you ask? Because the superclass of my models (think of my solution as a hacked-up PHP ActiveRecord wannabe) is where the querying is defined, and so the find() method, for example, doesn't know how many parameters it would need to bind.</p>

<p>Now, I've already thought of building an argument list and passing a string to eval(), but I don't like that solution very much -- I'd rather just implement my own security checks and pass on statements.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions (or success stories) about how to get this done? If you can help me solve this first problem, perhaps we can tackle binding the result set (something I suspect will be more difficult, or at least more resource-intensive if it involves an initial query to determine table structure).</p>

"Efficient JPEG Image Resizing in PHP","<p>What's the most efficient way to resize large images in PHP?</p>

<p>I'm currently using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD_Graphics_Library"" rel=""noreferrer"">GD</a> function imagecopyresampled to take high resolution images, and cleanly resize them down to a size for web viewing (roughly 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall).</p>

<p>This works great on small (under 2 MB) photos and the entire resize operation takes less than a second on the server. However, the site will eventually service photographers who may be uploading images up to 10 MB in size (or images up to 5000x4000 pixels in size).</p>

<p>Doing this kind of resize operation with large images tends to increase the memory usage by a very large margin (larger images can spike the memory usage for the script past 80 MB). Is there any way to make this resize operation more efficient? Should I be using an alternate image library such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick"" rel=""noreferrer"">ImageMagick</a>?</p>

<p>Right now, the resize code looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>function makeThumbnail($sourcefile, $endfile, $thumbwidth, $thumbheight, $quality) {
    // Takes the sourcefile (path/to/image.jpg) and makes a thumbnail from it
    // and places it at endfile (path/to/thumb.jpg).

"How can I pass data from an aspx page to an ascx modal popup?","<p>I'm fairly new to ASP.NET and trying to learn how things are done. I come from a C# background so the code-behind portion is easy, but thinking like a web developer is unfamiliar.</p>

<p>I have an aspx page that contains a grid of checkboxes. I have a button that is coded via a Button_Click event to collect a list of which rows are checked and create a session variable out of that list. The same button is referenced (via TargetControlID) by my ascx page's ModalPopupExtender which controls the panel on the ascx page.</p>

<p>When the button is clicked, the modal popup opens but the Button_Click event is never fired, so the modal doesn't get its session data.</p>

<p>Since the two pages are separate, I can't call the ModalPopupExtender from the aspx.cs code, I can't reach the list of checkboxes from the ascx.cs code, and I don't see a way to populate my session variable and then programmatically activate some other hidden button or control which will then open my modal popup.</p>

It is significantly smaller than the test table that I looped through and returned, and the query is small and fast - there is no issue here with timeouts or large data transfer.

<p>Update:  </p>

<p>Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.</p>

<p>So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. </p>

When wsdl.exe is run, it will automatically create proxy classes that contain just the data portion, and these will be automatically converted to and from my real business objects on the server side.  On the client side, they will only get to use the dumb proxy type, and they will have to map them into some real business objects as they see fit.  A big drawback here is that if I ""own"" both the server and client side, and I want to use the same set of real business objects, I can run into certain headaches with name conflicts, etc.  (Since the real objects and the proxies are named the same.)</p></li>
<li><p>Forget trying to pass ""real"" business objects.  Instead, just create simple DataTransfer objects which I will map back and forth to my real business objects manually.  They still get copied to new proxy objects by wsdl.exe anyway, but at least I'm not tricking myself into thinking that web services can natively handle objects with business logic in them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By the way - Does anyone know how to tell wsdl.exe to <em>not</em> make a copy of the object?  Shouldn't we be able to just tell it, ""Hey, use this existing type right over here. Don't copy it!""</p>

<p>Anyway, I've kinda settled on #2 for now, but I'm curious what you all think.  I have a feeling there are <em>way</em> better ways to do this in general, and I may not even be totally accurate on all my points, so please let me know what your experiences have been.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I just found out that VS 2008 has an option to reuse existing types when adding a ""Service Reference"", rather than creating brand new identical type in the proxy file. Sweet.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<li><em><strong>DRY violation</strong></em> - I have N references to my Struts action URLs instead of 1, which makes refactoring action URLs error-prone.</li>
<li><em><strong>Mixed concerns</strong></em> - My application's markup is now in more than just my JSP files, making it difficult for a web specialist to tweak the markup (using CSS, etc).</li>
<li><em><strong>Post-translation markup</strong></em> - Anytime I receive newly-translated text, I must decide what to surround with the <code>&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> markup. Easy for English but less so for unfamiliar languages.</li>
</ol>

"What are the advantages of using a single database for EACH client?","<p>In a database-centric application that is designed for multiple clients, I've always thought it was ""better"" to use a single database for ALL clients - associating records with proper indexes and keys.  In listening to the Stack Overflow podcast, I heard Joel mention that FogBugz uses one database per client (so if there were 1000 clients, there would be 1000 databases).  What are the advantages of using this architecture?</p>

<p>I understand that for some projects, clients need direct access to all of their data - in such an application, it's obvious that each client needs their own database.  However, for projects where a client does not need to access the database directly, are there any advantages to using one database per client?  It seems that in terms of flexibility, it's much simpler to use a single database with a single copy of the tables.  It's easier to add new features, it's easier to create reports, and it's just easier to manage.</p>

<p>I was pretty confident in the ""one database for all clients"" method until I heard Joel (an experienced developer) mention that his software uses a different approach -- and I'm a little confused with his decision...</p>

<p>I've heard people cite that databases slow down with a large number of records, but any relational database with some merit isn't going to have that problem - especially if proper indexes and keys are used.</p>

"How do you keep two related, but separate, systems in sync with each other?","<p>My current development project has two aspects to it. First, there is a public website where external users can submit and update information for various purposes. This information is then saved to a local SQL Server at the colo facility.</p>

<p>The second aspect is an internal application which employees use to manage those same records (conceptually) and provide status updates, approvals, etc. This application is hosted within the corporate firewall with its own local SQL Server database.</p>

<p>The two networks are connected by a hardware VPN solution, which is decent, but obviously not the speediest thing in the world.</p>

<p>The two databases are similar, and share many of the same tables, but they are not 100% the same. Many of the tables on both sides are very specific to either the internal or external application.</p>

<p>So the question is: when a user updates their information or submits a record on the public website, how do you transfer that data to the internal application's database so it can be managed by the internal staff? And vice versa... how do you push updates made by the staff back out to the website?</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that the more ""real time"" these updates occur, the better. Not that it has to be instant, just reasonably quick.</p>

<p>So far, I have thought about using the following types of approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bi-directional replication</li>
<li>Web service interfaces on both sides with code to sync the changes as they are made (in real time).</li>
<li>Web service interfaces on both sides with code to asynchronously sync the changes (using a queueing mechanism).</li>

"simultaneous Outlook reminders on multiple devices","<p><em>Disclaimer: This is not actually a programming question, but I feel the audience on stackoverflow is more likely to have an answer than most question/answer sites out there.</em></p>

<p>Please forgive me, Joel, for stealing your question.  Joel asked this question on a podcast a while back but I don't think it ever got resolved.  I'm in the same situation, so I'm also looking for the answer.  </p>

<p>I have multiple devices that all sync with MS-Outlook.  PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, PDAs, etc. all have the capability to synchronize their data (calendars, emails, contacts, etc.) with the Exchange server.  I like to use the Outlook meeting notice or appointment reminders to remind me of an upcoming meeting or doctors appointment or whatever.  The problem lies in the fact that all the devices pop up the same reminder and I have to go to every single device individually in order to snooze or dismiss all of the identical the reminder popups.  </p>

<p>Since this is a sync'ing technology, why doesn't the fact that I snooze or dismiss on one device sync up the other devices automatically.  I've even tried to force a sync after dismissing a reminder and it still shows up on my other devices after a forced sync.  This is utterly annoying to me.  </p>

<p>Is there a setting that I'm overlooking or is there a 3rd party reminder utility that I should be using instead of the built-in stuff?</p>

<li>hand-coding an initial compiler in Assembly, which seems like a special case of the first</li>

"Insert Update stored proc on SQL Server","<p>I've written a stored proc that will do an update if a record exists, otherwise it will do an insert. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>update myTable set Col1=@col1, Col2=@col2 where ID=@ID
if @@rowcount = 0
insert into myTable (Col1, Col2) values (@col1, @col2)
</code></pre>

<p>My logic behind writing it in this way is that the update will perform an implicit select using the where clause and if that returns 0 then the insert will take place.</p>

<p>The alternative to doing it this way would be to do a select and then based on the number of rows returned either do an update or insert. This I considered inefficient because if you are to do an update it will cause 2 selects (the first explicit select call and the second implicit in the where of the update). If the proc were to do an insert then there'd be no difference in efficiency.</p>

<p>Is my logic sound here?
Is this how you would combine an insert and update into a stored proc?</p>

<p>What got me to thinking about this was the SO question about a stripslashes()-like function in Python. My first thought was ""why not define your own and just call it when you need it"", but it raised the question: is it preferable, for such a function, to let the interpreted language handle that overhead, or would it be better to write an extension and leverage the compiled language behind the interpreter?</p>

"Textual versus Graphical Programming Languages","<p>I am part of a high school robotics team, and there is some debate about which language to use to program our robot.  We are choosing between C (or maybe C++) and LabVIEW.  There are pros for each language.</p>

<p>C(++):</p>

<ul>
<li>Widely used</li>
<li>Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)</li>
<li>We can expand upon our C codebase from last year</li>
<li>Allows us to better understand what our robot is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>LabVIEW</p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)</li>
<li>Easier to teach (Supposedly...)</li>
<li>""The future of programming is graphical.""  (Think so?)</li>
<li>Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.</li>
<li>Don't need to intimately know what's going on.  Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while.  Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, <strong>what do you think the better option is?</strong> Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency.  We also hope to prepare our programmers for a future in programming.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you think that graphical languages such as LabVEIW are the future of programming?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is a graphical language easier to learn than a textual language?</strong>  I think that they should be about equally challenging to learn.</li>
<li>Seeing as we are partailly rooted in helping people learn, <strong>how much should we rely on prewritten modules, and how much should we try to write on our own?</strong>  (""Good programmers write good code, great programmers copy great code.""  But isn't it worth being a good programmer, first?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the advice!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
I'd like to emphasize this question more:
The team captain thinks that LabVIEW is better for its ease of learning and teaching.  <strong>Is that true?</strong>  I think that C could be taught just as easily, and beginner-level tasks would still be around with C.  I'd really like to hear your opinions.  <strong>Is there any reason that typing while{} should be any more difficult than creating a ""while box?""</strong>  <strong>Isn't it just as intuitive that program flows line by line, only modified by ifs and loops, as it is intuitive that the program flows through the wire, only modified by ifs and loops!?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
I just realized that this falls under the topic of ""language debate.""  I hope it's okay, because it's about what's best for a specific branch of programming, with certain goals.  If it's not... I'm sorry...</p>

"How do I run (unit) tests in different folders/projects separately in Visual Studio?","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DibJS.jpg"" alt=""Visual Studio folder structure""></p>

<p>I need some advice as to how I easily can separate test runs for unit tests and integration test in Visual Studio. Often, or always, I structure the solution as presented in the above picture: separate projects for unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests is run very frequently while the integration tests naturally is run when the context is correctly aligned.</p>

<p>My goal is to somehow be able configure which tests (or test folders) to run when I use a keyboard shortcut. The tests should preferably be run by a graphical test runner (ReSharpers). So for example</p>

<ul>
<li>Alt+1 runs the tests in project BLL.Test, </li>
<li>Alt+2 runs the tests in project DAL.Tests, </li>
<li>Alt+3 runs them both (i.e. all the tests in the [Tests] folder, and</li>
<li>Alt+4 runs the tests in folder [Tests.Integration].</li>
</ul>

<p>TestDriven.net have an option of running just the test in the selected folder or project by right-clicking it and select Run Test(s). Being able to do this, but via a keyboard command and with a graphical test runner would be awesome.</p>

"Database triggers","<p>In the past I've never been a fan of using triggers on database tables. To me they always represented some ""magic"" that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code. I also wanted to limit the amount of work the DB had to do, as it's generally a shared resource and I always assumed triggers could get to be expensive in high load scenarios.</p>

<p>That said, I have found a couple of instances where triggers have made sense to use (at least in my opinion they made sense). Recently though, I found myself in a situation where I sometimes might need to ""bypass"" the trigger. I felt really guilty about having to look for ways to do this, and I still think that a better database design would alleviate the need for this bypassing. Unfortunately this DB is used by mulitple applications, some of which are maintained by a very uncooperative development team who would scream about schema changes, so I was stuck.</p>

"Automated testing a game","<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How would you go adding automated testing to a game?</p>

<p>I believe you can unit test a lot of the game engine's functionality (networking, object creation, memory management, etc), but is it possible to automate test the actual game itself?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about gameplay elements (like Protoss would beat Zerg in map X), but I'm talking about the interaction between the game and the engine.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In game development, the engine is just a platform for the game. You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Answers</strong></p>

<p>My idea is this: </p>

<p>You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.</p>

<p>Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.</p>

<p>Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your automated test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.</p>

"How can I test STDIN without blocking in Perl?","<p>I'm writing my first Perl app -- an AOL Instant Messenger bot that talks to an Arduino microcontroller, which in turn controls a servo that will push the power button on our sysadmin's server, which freezes randomly every 28 hours or so. </p>

"When should a multi-module project to split into separate repository trees?","<p>Currently we have a project with a standard subversion repository layout of:</p>

<p>./trunk<br>
./branches<br>

<p>However, as we're moving down the road of OSGi and a modular project, we've ended up with:</p>

<p>./trunk/bundle/main<br>
./trunk/bundle/modulea<br>
./trunk/bundle/moduleb
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.0<br>
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.1<br>
./tags/bundle/modulea-1.0.0</p>

<p>The 'build' is still quite monolithic in that it builds all modules in sequence, though I'm starting to wonder if we should refactor the build/repository to something more like:</p>

<p>./bundle/main/trunk<br>
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.0<br>
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.1<br>
./bundle/modulea/trunk<br>

"How should I handle autolinking in wiki page content?","<p>What I mean by autolinking is the process by which wiki links inlined in page content are generated into either a hyperlink to the page (if it does exist) or a create link (if the page doesn't exist).</p>

<p>What is the best way to handle this process? It seems as if I need to keep a cached list of every single page on the site, rather than having to extract the index of page titles each time. Or is it better to check each link separately to see if it exists? This might result in a lot of database lookups if the list wasn't cached.

"Static Methods in an Interface/Abstract Class","<p>First off, I understand the reasons why an interface or abstract class (in the .NET/C# terminology) cannot have abstract static methods.  My question is then more focused on the best design solution.</p>

<p>What I want is a set of ""helper"" classes that all have their own static methods such that if I get objects A, B, and C from a third party vendor, I can have helper classes with methods such as</p>

<pre>
AHelper.RetrieveByID(string id);
AHelper.RetrieveByName(string name);
AHelper.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>

<p>Since my AHelper, BHelper, and CHelper classes will all basically have the same methods, it seems to makes sense to move these methods to an interface that these classes then derive from.  However, wanting these methods to be static precludes me from having a generic interface or abstract class for all of them to derive from.</p>

<p>I could always make these methods non-static and then instantiate the objects first such as</p>

<pre>
AHelper a = new AHelper();
a.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>

<p>However, this code doesn't seem as intuitive to me.  What are your suggestions?  Should I abandon using an interface or abstract class altogether (the situation I'm in now) or can this possibly be refactored to accomplish the design I'm looking for?</p>

"Issues with DB after publishing via Database Publishing Wizard from MSFT","<p>I work on quite a few DotNetNuke sites, and occasionally (I haven't figured out the common factor yet), when I use the Database Publishing Wizard from Microsoft to create scripts for the site I've created on my Dev server, after running the scripts at the host (usually GoDaddy.com), and uploading the site files, I get an error...  I'm 99.9% sure that it's not file related, so not sure where to begin in the DB.  Unfortunately with DotNetNuke you don't get the YSOD, but a generic error, with no real way to find the actual exception that has occured.</p>

<p>I'm just curious if anyone has had similar deployment issues using the Database Publishing Wizard, and if so, how they overcame them?  I own the RedGate toolset, but some hosts like GoDaddy don't allow you to direct connect to their servers...</p>

"How to get started with speech-to-text?","<p>I'm really interested in speech-to-text algorithms, but I'm not sure where to start studying up on them. A bunch of searching around led me to <a href=""http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/HLTsurvey/download.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>, but it's from 1996 and I'm fairly certain that there have been improvements since then.</p>

<p>Does anyone who has any experience with this sort of stuff have any recommendations for reading / source code to examine? Or just general advice on what I should be trying to learn about if I want to get into the world of writing speech recognition programs (sometimes it's hard to know what to search for if you don't have much knowledge about the domain).</p>

<p>Edit: I'd like to do something cross-platform, but for the moment I'd be targeting linux. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks csmba for the well-thought out reply. At this point in time, I'm mainly interested in being able to create applications that allow automation, or execution of different commands through voice. So, a limited amount of recognizable commands being able to be strung together. An example would be a music player that took commands like ""Play the album Hello Everything by Squarepusher"", or an application launcher that allowed the user to create voice-shortcuts to launch specific apps.</p>

<p>I realize that it's a pretty giant problem, and that I have nowhere near the level of knowledge required right now to tackle implementing an entire recognition engine, although the techniques involved with doing so fascinate me, and it is something I'd like to work myself up to doing. In all likelihood, I'll probably end up picking up a book or two on the subject and studying up / playing with ""simple"" implementations in my free time.</p>

"Mixed C++/CLI TypeLoadException Internal limitation: too many fields","<p>On a quest to migrate some new UI into Managed/C# land, I have recently turned on Common Language Runtime Support (/clr) on a large legacy project, which uses MFC in a Shared DLL and relies on about a dozen other projects within our overall solution. This project is the core of our application, and would drive any managed UI code that is produced (hence the need to turn on clr support for interop). </p>

<p>After fixing a ton of little niggly errors and warnings, I finally managed to get the application to compile.. 
However, running the application causes an EETypeLoadException and leaves me unable to debug...</p>

<p>Doing some digging, I found the cause to be ""System.TypeLoadException: Internal limitation: too many fields."" which occurs right at the end of compilation.

However, this is not possible in my case, as a limitation I have is that the legacy code basically remains untouched.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest any other possible solutions? I'm really at a dead end here.</p>

<p>How would you go about finding the best combination programmatically?</p>

<p>My best attempt so far (third or fourth algorithm) is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the longest shipper for each leg</li>
<li>Eliminate the most ""expensive"" one</li>
<li>Find the cheapest shipper for each leg</li>
<li>Calculate the total cost &amp; days</li>
<li>If days are acceptable, finish, else, goto 1</li>

"Improving Your Build Process","<p>Or, actually establishing a build process when there isn't much of one in place to begin with.</p>

<p>Currently, that's pretty much the situation my group faces.  We do web-app development primarily (but no desktop development at this time).  Software deployments are ugly and unwieldy even with our modest apps, and we've had far too many issues crop up in the two years I have been a part of this team (and company).  It's past time to do something about that, and the upshot is that we'll be able to kill two Joel Test birds with one stone (daily builds and one-step builds, neither of which exists in any form whatsoever).</p>

<p>What I'm after here is some general insight on the kinds of things I need to be doing or thinking about, from people who have been in software development for longer than I have and also have bigger brains.  I'm confident that will be most of the people currently posting in the beta.</p>

<p>Relevant Tools:
Visual Build
Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time.  That might be the next battle I fight.)</p>

<p>Tentatively, I've got a Visual Build project that does this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project.</li>
<li>Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use).</li>
<li>Build using Visual Studio</li>
<li>Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a ""build"" directory</li>
<li>Copy to destination.</li>
<li>Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5).  There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously.  However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant.  I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make?  We're not currently using a Deployment Project, I'll note.  It would remove some of the steps necessary in this build I presume (like web.config swapping).</p>

"Tree-Based (vs. HTML-Based) Web Framework?","<p>Anyone who writes client-side JavaScript is familiar with the DOM - the tree structure that your browser references in memory, generated from the HTML it got from the server. JavaScript can add, remove and modify nodes on the DOM tree to make changes to the page. I find it very nice to work with (browser bugs aside), and very different from the way my server-side code has to generate the page in the first place.</p>

<p>My question is: what server-side frameworks/languages build a page by treating it as a DOM tree from the beginning - inserting nodes instead of echoing strings? I think it would be very helpful if the client-side and server-side code both saw the page the same way. You could certainly hack something like this together in any web server language, but a framework dedicated to creating a page this way could make some very nice optimizations.</p>

"Can placement new for arrays be used in a portable way?","<p>Is it possible to actually make use of placement new in portable code when using it for arrays?</p>

<p>It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.</p>

<p>The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

class A
{
    public:

    A() : data(0) {}
    virtual ~A() {}
    int data;
};

int main()
{
    const int NUMELEMENTS=20;

    char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)];
    A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS];

    // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer
    printf(""Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n"", pBuffer, pA);

    // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
    delete[] pBuffer;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.</p>

<p>So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.</p>

That is unless someone suggest some brilliant library for doing this that I've missed.</p>

"Optimizing the PDF Export of Huge Reports in Sql Reporting Services 2005","<p>First off I understand that it is a horrible idea to run extremely large/long running reports. I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.</p>

<p>At my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. </p>

<p>So far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we can't seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:</p>

<p>Exception Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.</p>

<p>The web service call is something I'm sure you all have seen before:  </p>

<pre><code>data = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,
   selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, 
   out warnings, out streamIds);
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.</p>

<p>Here are some of the more obvious things I've tried to get the report working via the web service API:  </p>

<ul>
<li>set the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout
value to 3 hours on the report
server</li>
<li>disabled http keep alives on the report server</li>
<li>increased the script timeout on the report server</li>
<li>set the report to never time out on the server</li>
<li>set the report timeout to several hours on the client call  </li>
</ul>

<p>From the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. </p>

<p>Based off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I can't seem to find a way to enable response chunking. </p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?</li>
<li>Is there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?</li>
<li>Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?</li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: After reading kcrumley's post I began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size / page count. Interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5K. Interestingly, when the report gets larger this ""average"" increases. An 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40K/page. Very odd. I will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping, so it's not a case where some pages have more records than another. </p>

"How to create short snippets in Vim?","<p>I have recently started using Vim as my text editor and am currently working on my own customizations.</p>

<p>I suppose keyboard mappings can do pretty much anything, but for the time being I'm using them as a sort of snippets facility almost exclusively.</p>

<pre><code>def |(): # '|' represents the caret

<p>This works as expected, but I find it annoying when Vim waits for a full command while I'm typing a word containing ""def"" and am not interested in expanding it.</p>

"Using Visual Studio to develop for C++ for Unix","<p>Does anyone have battle stories to share trying to use Visual Studio to develop applications for Unix?  And I'm not talking using .NET with a Mono or Wine virtual platform running beneath.</p>

<p>Our company has about 20 developers all running Windows XP/Vista and developing primarily for Linux &amp; Solaris.  Until recently we all logged into a main Linux server and modified/built code the good old fashioned way: Emacs, Vi, dtpad - take your pick.  Then someone said, ""hey - we're living in the Dark Ages, we should be using an IDE"".</p>

<p>So we tried out a few and decided that Visual Studio was the only one that would meet our performance needs (yes, I'm sure that IDE X is a very nice IDE, but we chose VS).</p>

<p>The problem is, how do you setup your environment to have the files available locally to VS, but also available to a build server?  We settled with writing a Visual Studio plugin - it writes our files locally and to the build server whenever we hit ""Save"" and we have a bit fat ""sync"" button that we can push when our files change on the server side (for when we update to the latest files from our source control server).  </p>

<p>The plugin also uses Visual Studio's external build system feature that ultimately just ssh's into the build server and calls our local ""make"" utility (which is Boost Build v2 - has great dependency checking, but is <em>really</em> slow to start as a result i.e. 30-60 seconds to begin).  The results are piped back into Visual Studio so the developer can click on the error and be taken to the appropriate line of code (quite slick actually).  The build server uses GCC and cross-compiles all of our Solaris builds.</p>

<p>But even after we've done all this, I can't help but sigh whenever I start to write code in Visual Studio.  I click a file, start typing, and VS chugs to catch up with me.</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition, the client profile is <strong>not</strong> valid for x64 or ia64 editions; and will also not install if <em>any previous version of the .NET Framework has been installed</em>.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the effort in adding the extra OS configurations to the testing matrix is worth the effort. Is there any metrics available that state the percentage of users that could possibly benefit from the client profile? I believe that once the .NET Framework has been installed, extra information is passed to a web server as part of a web request signifying that the framework is available. Granted, I would imagine that Windows XP SP2 users without the .NET Framework installed would be a large amount of people. It would then be a question of whether my application targeted those individuals specifically.</p>

<p>Has anyone else determined if it is worth the extra effort to target these specific users?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: It seems that it is possible to get a compiler warning if you use features not included in the Client Profile. As I usually run with warnings as errors, this will hopefully be enough to minimise testing in this configuration.</strong> Of course, this configuration will still need to be tested, but it should be as simple as testing if the install/initial run works on XP with SP2+.</p>

"Why are my auto-run applications acting weird on Vista?","<p>The product we are working on allows the user to easily set it up to run automatically whenever the computer is started. This is helpful because the product is part of the basic work environment of most of our users.<br>
This feature was implemented not so long ago and for a while all was well, but when we started testing this feature on Vista the product started behaving really weird on startup. Specifically, our product makes use of another product (lets call it X) that it launches whenever it needs its services. The actual problem is that whenever X is launched immediately after log-on, it crashes or reports critical errors related to disk access (this happens even when X is launched directly - not through our product).</p>

<p>This happens whenever we run our product by registering it in the ""Run"" key in the registry or place a shortcut to it in the ""<em>Startup</em>"" folder inside the ""<em>Start Menu</em>"", even when we put a delay of ~20 seconds before actually starting to run. When we changed the delay to 70 seconds, all is well.</p>

<p>We tried to reproduce the problem by launching our product manually immediately after logon (by double-clicking on a shortcut placed on the desktop) but to no avail.</p>

<p>Now how is it possible that applications that run normally a minute after logon report such hard errors when starting immediately after logon?</p>

"RSS/Atom for professional use","<p>I wondered if anyone can give an example of a professional use of RSS/Atom feeds in a company product. Does anyone use feeds for other things than updating news?</p>

<p>For example, did you create a product that gives results as RSS/Atom feeds? Like price listings or current inventory, or maybe dates of training lessons?</p>

<p>Or am I thinking in a wrong way of use cases for RSS/Atom feeds anyway?</p>

"Fonts on the Web","<p>The collection of fonts available to a web developer is depressingly limited.

"Learning about LINQ","<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">LINQ</a>. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ.</p>
<p>I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ.</p>
<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>
<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LINQ Project is a codename for a
set of extensions to the .NET
Framework that encompass
language-integrated query, set, and
transform operations. It extends C#
and Visual Basic with native language
syntax for queries and provides class
libraries to take advantage of these
capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax.</p>
<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>
<p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588"">Andrei</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Dataset</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are quite a few others, many of which are listed <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li>
<li>Compile time safety of queries</li>
<li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li>
<li>Ability to debug queries</li>

<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>
<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)</p>
<p>There is also a tool called <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"">LinqBridge</a> which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0.</p>

"How do I generate a hashcode from a byte array in C#?","<p>Say I have an object that stores a byte array and I want to be able to efficiently generate a hashcode for it. I've used the cryptographic hash functions for this in the past because they are easy to implement, but they are doing a lot more work than they should to be cryptographically oneway, and I don't care about that (I'm just using the hashcode as a key into a hashtable).</p>

<p>Here's what I have today:</p>

<pre><code>struct SomeData : IEquatable&lt;SomeData&gt;
{
    private readonly byte[] data;
    public SomeData(byte[] data)
    {
        if (null == data || data.Length &lt;= 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(""data"");
        }
        this.data = new byte[data.Length];
        Array.Copy(data, this.data, data.Length);
    }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        return obj is SomeData &amp;&amp; Equals((SomeData)obj);
    }

    public bool Equals(SomeData other)
    {
        if (other.data.Length != data.Length)
        {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.Length; ++i)
        {
            if (data[i] != other.data[i])
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return BitConverter.ToInt32(new MD5CryptoServiceProvider().ComputeHash(data), 0);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p>dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();
</code></pre>

<p>With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes. I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.</p>

"Reading ""chunked"" response with HttpWebResponse","<p>I'm having trouble reading a ""chunked"" response when using a StreamReader to read the stream returned by GetResponseStream() of a HttpWebResponse:</p>

string output = reader.ReadToEnd(); // throws exception...

<p>When the <code>reader.ReadToEnd()</code> method is called I'm getting the following System.IO.IOException: <strong>Unable to read data from the transport connection: The connection was closed.</strong></p>

<p>The above code works just fine when server returns a ""non-chunked"" response.</p>

<p>Your solution works pretty good. It still throws the same IOExeception on the last Read(). But after inspecting the contents of the StringBuilder it looks like all the data has been received. So perhaps I just need to wrap the Read() in a try-catch and swallow the ""error"".</p>

Bikes      12 000      2008        2
Bikes      12 000      2008        3

Bikes      15 400      2007        4
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
... And so forth</p>

<p>The view has a product  category, a revenue, a year and a month. I want to create a report comparing 2007 and 2008, showing 0 for the months with no sales. So the report should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Category  |  Month  |  Rev. This Year  |  Rev. Last Year
Bikes          1          10 000               0
Bikes          2          12 000               11 000
Bikes          3          12 000               11 500
Bikes          4          0                    15 400
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
The key thing to notice is how month 1 only has sales in 2008, and therefore is 0 for 2007. Also, month 4 only has no sales in 2008, hence the 0, while it has sales in 2007 and still show up.</p>

<p>Also, the report is actually for financial year - so I would love to have empty columns with 0 in both if there was no sales in say month 5 for either 2007 or 2008.</p>

<p>The query I got looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    SP1.Program,
    SP1.Year,
    SP1.Month,
    SP1.TotalRevenue,
    IsNull(SP2.TotalRevenue, 0) AS LastYearTotalRevenue

"Why are DispatcherObject.CheckAccess() and VerifyAccess() hidden from Intellisense?","<p>The <code>System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject</code> class (which <code>DependencyObject</code> is based on) contains a useful function, called <code>CheckAccess()</code>, that determines whether or not the code is running on the UI thread.</p>

<p>When I wanted to use it yesterday, I was puzzled to find out that Intellisense didn't show the function (nor <code>VerifyAccess()</code>, which throws an exception when not on the UI thread), even though the MSDN library lists it. I decided to investigate the class using Reflector. It seems that the function in question has an <code>EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)</code> attribute attached to it. The <code>Dispatcher</code> class, which is used by <code>DispatcherObject</code>, has the same attribute attached to <code>CheckAccess()</code> and <code>VerifyAccess()</code>:</p>

"ASP.NET Custom Controls - Composites","<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi All,<br />
OK, further into my adventures with custom controls...</p>
<p>In summary, here is that I have learned of three main &quot;classes&quot; of custom controls. Please feel free to correct me if any of this is wrong!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>UserControls</strong> - Which inherit from <em>UserControl</em> and are contained within an <em>ASCX</em> file. These are pretty limited in what they can do, but are a quick and light way to get some UI commonality with designer support.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Composite Controls</strong> - These are controls that inherit from <em>WebControl</em> where you add pre-existing controls to the control within the <em>CreateChildControls</em> method. This provides great flexibility, but lack of designer support without additional coding. They are highly portable though since they can be compiled into a DLL.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Rendered Controls</strong> - Similar to Custom Composite Controls, these are added to a Web Control Library project. The rendering of the control is completely controlled by the programmer by overriding the <em>Render</em> method.</li>
</ol>
<h2>My Thoughts..</h2>
<p>OK, so while playing with custom composites, I found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have little/no control over the HTML output making it difficult to &quot;debug&quot;.</li>
<li>The <em>CreateChildControls</em> (and subsequent methods) can get real busy with <em>Controls.Add(myControl)</em> everywhere.</li>
<li>I found rendering tables (be it for layout or content) to be considerably awkward.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Question(s)..</h2>
<p>So, I admit, I am new to this so I could be way off-base with some of my points noted above..</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you use Composites?</li>
<li>Do you have any neat tricks to control the HTML output?</li>
<li>Do you just say &quot;to hell with it&quot; and go ahead and create a custom rendered control?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Its something I am keen to get really firm in my mind since I know how much <em>good</em> control development can cut overall development time.</strong></p>

<p>Basically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.</p>

<p>Obviously, each project is unique, so my question here is <strong>not</strong> so much <strong>whether</strong> assertions should be kept, <strong>but in which cases</strong> this is recommendable/not a good idea.</p>

<p>By assertion, I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>A run-time check that tests a condition which, when false, reveals a bug in the software.</li>
<li>A mechanism by which the program is halted (maybe after really minimal clean-up work).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not necessarily talking about C or C++.</p>

<p>My own opinion is that if you're the programmer, but don't own the data (which is the case with most commercial desktop applications), you should keep them on, because a failing asssertion shows a bug, and you should not go on with a bug, with the risk of corrupting the user's data. This forces you to test strongly before you ship, and makes bugs more visible, thus easier to spot and fix.</p>

<p>What's your opinion/experience?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p><strong>Responses and Updates</strong></p>

<p>Hey Graham,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An assertion is error, pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one.
  Since an error should be handled in release mode then you don't really need assertions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's why I prefer the word ""bug"" when talking about assertions. It makes things much clearer. To me, the word ""error"" is too vague. A missing file is an error, not a bug, and the program should deal with it. Trying to dereference a null pointer is a bug, and the program should acknowledge that something smells like bad cheese.</p>

<p>Hence, you should test the pointer with an assertion, but the presence of the file with normal error-handling code.</p>

<hr>

<p>Slight off-topic, but an important point in the discussion.</p>

<p>As a heads-up, if your assertions break into the debugger when they fail, why not. But there are plenty of reasons a file could not exist that are completely outside of the control of your code: read/write rights, disk full, USB device unplugged, etc. Since you don't have control over it, I feel assertions are not the right way to deal with that.</p>

<p>Carl</p>

<hr>

<p>Thomas,</p>

<p>Yes, I have Code Complete, and must say I strongly disagree with that particular advice.</p>

<p>Say your custom memory allocator screws up, and zeroes a chunk of memory that is still used by some other object. I happens to zero a pointer that this object dereferences regularly, and one of the invariants is that this pointer is never null, and you have a couple of assertions to make sure it stays that way. What do you do if the pointer suddenly is null. You just if() around it, hoping that it works?</p>

<p>Remember, we're talking about product code here, so there's no breaking into the debugger and inspecting the local state. This is a real bug on the user's machine.</p>

"Listen for events in another application","<p>Suppose I have two applications written in C#. The first is a third party application that raises an event called ""OnEmailSent"".</p>

<p>The second is a custom app that I've written that I would like to somehow subscribe to the ""OnEmailSent"" even of the first application.</p>

<p>Is there any way that I could somehow attach the second application to an instance of the first application to listen for ""OnEmailSent"" event?</p>

<hr>

<p>So for further clarification, my specific scenario is that we have a custom third party application written in c# that raises an ""OnEmailSent"" event. We can see the event exists using reflector.</p>

<p>What we want to do is have some other actions take place when this component sends an email.</p>

<p>The most efficient way we can think of would be to be able to use some form of IPC as anders has suggested and listen for the OnEmailSent event being raised by the third party component.</p>

<p>Because the component is written in C# we are toying with the idea of writing another C# application that can attach itself to the executing process and when it detect the OnEmailSent event has been raise it will execute it's own event handling code.</p>

<hr>

<p>I might be missing something, but from what I understand of how remoting works is that there would need to be a server defining some sort of contract that the client can subscribe to.</p>

<p>I was more thinking about a scenario where someone has written a standalone application like outlook for example, that exposes events that I would like to subscribe to from another application.</p>

<p>I guess the scenario I'm thinking of is the .net debugger and how it can attach to executing assemblies to inspect the code whilst it's running.</p>

"Enabling a button in WPF depending on ListBox.SelectedIndex","<p>I have a rather classic UI situation - two ListBoxes named <code>SelectedItems</code> and <code>AvailableItems</code> - the idea being that the items you have already selected live in <code>SelectedItems</code>, while the items that are available for adding to <code>SelectedItems</code> (i.e. every item that isn't already in there) live in <code>AvailableItems</code>.</p>

<p>Also, I have the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> buttons to move the current selection from one list to the other (in addition to double clicking, which works fine).</p>

<p>Is it possible in WPF to set up a style/trigger to enable or disable the move buttons depending on anything being selected in either ListBox? <code>SelectedItems</code> is on the left side, so the <code>&lt;</code> button will move the selected <code>AvailableItems</code> to that list.

"Prevent WebBrowser control from swallowing exceptions","<p>I'm using the <code>System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser</code>, to make a view a-la Visual Studio Start Page. However, it seems the control is catching and handling all exceptions by silently sinking them! No need to tell this is a very unfortunate behaviour.</p>

<pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e)
{
    // WebBrowser.Navigating event handler
    throw new Exception(""OMG!"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above will cancel navigation and swallow the exception.</p>

<pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e)
{
    // WebBrowser.Navigating event handler
    try
    {
        e.Cancel = true;
        if (actions.ContainsKey(e.Url.ToString()))
        {
            actions[e.Url.ToString()].Invoke(e.Url, webBrowser.Document);
        }
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(exception.ToString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, what I do (above) is catch all exceptions and pop a box, this is better than silently failing but still clearly far from ideal. I'd like it to redirect the exception through the normal application failure path so that it ultimately becomes unhandled, or handled by the application from the root.</p>

<p>Is there any way to tell the <code>WebBrowser</code> control to stop sinking the exceptions and just forward them the natural and expected way? Or is there some hacky way to throw an exception through native boundaries?</p>

"The best way of checking for -moz-border-radius support","<p>I wanted some of those spiffy rounded corners for a web project that I'm currently working on.</p>

<p>I thought I'd try to accomplish it using javascript and not CSS in an effort to keep the requests for image files to a minimum (yes, I know that it's possible to combine all required rounded corner shapes into one image) and I also wanted to be able to change the background color pretty much on the fly.</p>

<p>I already utilize jQuery so I looked at the excellent <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/corners"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rounded corners plugin</a> and it worked like a charm in every browser I tried. Being a developer however I noticed the opportunity to make it a bit more efficient. The script already includes code for detecting if the current browser supports webkit rounded corners (safari based browsers). If so it uses raw CSS instead of creating layers of divs.</p>

<p>I thought that it would be awesome if the same kind of check could be performed to see if the browser supports the Gecko-specific <code>-moz-border-radius-*</code> properties and if so utilize them.</p>

<p>The check for webkit support looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var webkitAvailable = false;  
try {  
    webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined);
} 
catch(err) {}
</code></pre>

<p>That, however, did not work for <code>-moz-border-radius</code> so I started checking for alternatives.</p>

<p>My fallback solution is of course to use browser detection but that's far from recommended practice ofcourse.</p>

<p>My best solution yet is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>var mozborderAvailable = false;
try {
    var o = jQuery('&lt;div&gt;').css('-moz-border-radius', '1px');
    mozborderAvailable = $(o).css('-moz-border-radius-topleft') == '1px';
    o = null;
} catch(err) {}
</code></pre>

<p>It's based on the theory that Gecko ""expands"" the composite -moz-border-radius to the four sub-properties</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-topleft</code></li>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-topright</code></li>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-bottomleft</code></li>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-bottomright</code></li>
</ul>

So is there really no way to do this with form Size? <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/UserSettings.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This tutorial</a> says you need to handle Size explicitly so you can save RestoreBounds instead of size if the window is maximized or minimized.

"Why do we need entity objects?","<p>I really need to see some honest, thoughtful debate on the merits of the currently accepted <strong><em>enterprise application</em></strong> design paradigm.</p>

<p>I am not convinced that entity objects should exist.</p>

<p>By entity objects I mean the typical things we tend to build for our applications, like ""Person"", ""Account"", ""Order"", etc.</p>

<p>My current design philosophy is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>All database access must be accomplished via stored procedures.</li>
<li>Whenever you need data, call a stored procedure and iterate over a SqlDataReader or the rows in a DataTable</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: I have also built enterprise applications with Java EE, java folks please substitute the equvalent for my .NET examples)</p>

<p>I am not anti-OO.  I write lots of classes for different purposes, just not entities.  I will admit that a large portion of the classes I write are static helper classes.</p>

<p>I am not building toys.  I'm talking about large, high volume transactional applications deployed across multiple machines.  Web applications, windows services, web services, b2b interaction, you name it.</p>

<p>I have used OR Mappers.  I have written a few.  I have used the Java EE stack, CSLA, and a few other equivalents.  I have not only used them but actively developed and maintained these applications in production environments.</p>

<p>I have come to the battle-tested conclusion that entity objects are getting in our way, and our lives would be <em>so</em> much easier without them.</p>

<p>Consider this simple example: you get a support call about a certain page in your application that is not working correctly, maybe one of the fields is not being persisted like it should be.  With my model, the developer assigned to find the problem opens <em>exactly 3 files</em>.  An ASPX, an ASPX.CS and a SQL file with the stored procedure.  The problem, which might be a missing parameter to the stored procedure call, takes minutes to solve.  But with any entity model, you will invariably fire up the debugger, start stepping through code, and you may end up with 15-20 files open in Visual Studio.  By the time you step down to the bottom of the stack, you forgot where you started.  We can only keep so many things in our heads at one time.  Software is incredibly complex without adding any unnecessary layers.</p>

<p>Development complexity and troubleshooting are just one side of my gripe.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about scalability.</p>

<p>Do developers realize that each and every time they write or modify any code that interacts with the database, they need to do a throrough analysis of the exact impact on the database?  And not just the development copy, I mean a mimic of production, so you can see that the additional column you now require for your object just invalidated the current query plan and a report that was running in 1 second will now take 2 minutes, just because you added a single column to the select list?  And it turns out that the index you now require is so big that the DBA is going to have to modify the physical layout of your files?</p>

<p>If you let people get too far away from the physical data store with an abstraction, they will create havoc with an application that needs to scale.</p>

<p>I am not a zealot.  I can be convinced if I am wrong, and maybe I am, since there is such a strong push towards Linq to Sql, ADO.NET EF, Hibernate, Java EE, etc.  Please think through your responses, if I am missing something I really want to know what it is, and why I should change my thinking.</p>

<p><strong><em>[Edit]</em></strong></p>

<p>It looks like this question is suddenly active again, so now that we have the new comment feature I have commented directly on several answers.  Thanks for the replies, I think this is a healthy discussion.</p>

<p>I probably should have been more clear that I am talking about enterprise applications.  I really can't comment on, say, a game that's running on someone's desktop, or a mobile app.</p>

<p>One thing I have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers: orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity/ORM.  Stored procedures, to me, are the best example of separation of concerns that I can think of.  If you disallow all other access to the database, other than via stored procedures, you could in theory redesign your entire data model and not break any code, so long as you maintained the inputs and outputs of the stored procedures.  They are a perfect example of programming by contract (just so long as you avoid ""select *"" and document the result sets).</p>

<p>Ask someone who's been in the industry for a long time and has worked with long-lived applications: how many application and UI layers have come and gone while a database has lived on?  How hard is it to tune and refactor a database when there are 4 or 5 different persistence layers generating SQL to get at the data?  You can't change anything!  ORMs or any code that generates SQL <strong><em>lock your database in stone</em></strong>.</p>

I'm on a Mac, so I would think a simple bash script should be able to handle it, but I've never done anything in bash and haven't had any luck.  It seems like it should be simple to write something so I could just run:</p>

"Using ASP.NET MVC, how to best avoid writing both the Add View and Edit View?","<p>The Add view and the Edit view are often incredibly similar that it is unwarranted to write 2 views. As the app evolves you would be making the same changes to both.</p>

<p>However, there are usually subtle differences. For instance, a field might be read-only once it's been added, and if that field is a DropDownList you no longer need that List in the ViewData.</p>

<p>So, should I create a view data class which contains all the information for both views, where, depending on the operation you're performing, certain properties will be null?<br>
Should I include the operation in the view data as an enum?<br>
Should I surround all the subtle differences with <em>&lt;% if( ViewData.Model.Op == Ops.Editing ) { %></em> ?</p>

"Asp.net MVC User Control ViewData","<p>When a controller renders a view based on a model you can get the properties from the ViewData collection using the indexer (ie. ViewData[""Property""]).  However, I have a shared user control that I tried to call using the following:</p>

<pre><code>return View(""Message"", new { DisplayMessage = ""This is a test"" });

<p>and on my Message control I had this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= ViewData[""DisplayMessage""] %&gt;

<p>I would think this would render the DisplayMessage correctly, however, null is being returned.  After a heavy dose of tinkering around, I finally created a ""MessageData"" class in order to strongly type my user control:</p>

<pre><code>public class MessageControl : ViewUserControl&lt;MessageData&gt;

<p>and now this call works:</p>

<pre><code>return View(""Message"", new MessageData() { DisplayMessage = ""This is a test"" });

<p>and can be displayed like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= ViewData.Model.DisplayMessage %&gt;

<p>Why wouldn't the DisplayMessage property be added to the ViewData (ie. ViewData[""DisplayMessage""]) collection without strong typing the user control?  Is this by design?  Wouldn't it make sense that ViewData would contain a key for ""DisplayMessage""?</p>

"Obscuring network proxy password in plain text files on Linux/UNIX-likes","<p>Typically in a large network a computer needs to operate behind an authenticated proxy - any connections to the outside world require a username/password which is often the password a user uses to log into email, workstation etc.</p>

<p>This means having to put the network password in the <code>apt.conf</code> file as well as typically the <code>http_proxy, ftp_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code> environment variables defined in <code>~/.profile</code></p>

<p>I realise that with <code>apt.conf</code> that you could set <code>chmod 600</code> (which it isn't by default on Ubuntu/Debian!) but on our system there are people who need root priveleges .</p>

<p>I also realise that it is technically impossible to secure a password from someone who has root access, however I was wondering if there was a way of <i>obscuring</i> the password to prevent accidental discovery. Windows operates with users as admins yet somehow stores network passwords (probably stored deep in the registry obscured in some way) so that in typical use you won't stumble across it in plain text</p>

<p>I only ask since the other day, I entirely by accident discovered somebody elses password in this way when comparing configuration files across systems.</p>

"How to match linux device path to windows drive name?","<p>I'm writing an application that on some stage performs low-level disk operations in Linux environment. The app actually consists of 2 parts, one runs on Windows and interacts with a user and another is a linux part that runs from a LiveCD. User makes a choice of Windows drive letters and then a linux part performs actions with corresponding partitions. The problem is finding a match between a Windows drive letter (like C:) and a linux device name (like /dev/sda1). This is my current solution that I rate as ugly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>store partitions information (i.e. drive letter, number of blocks, drive serial number etc.) in Windows in some pre-defined place (i.e. the root of the system partition).</p></li>
<li><p>read a list of partitions from /proc/partitions. Get only those partitions that has major number for SCSI or IDE hard drives and minor number that identifies them as real partitions and not the whole disks.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to mount each of them with either ntfs or vfat file systems. Check whether the mounted partition contains the information stored by Windows app.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon finding the required information written by the Windows app make the actual match. For each partition found in /proc/partitions acquire drive serial number (via HDIO_GET_IDENTITY syscall), number of blocks (from /proc/partitions) and drive offset (/sys/blocks/drive_path/partition_name/start), compare this to the Windows information and if this matches - store a Windows drive letter along with a linux device name. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of problems in this scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is ugly. Writing data in Windows and then reading it in Linux makes testing a nightmare.</p></li>
<li><p>linux device major number is compared only with IDE or SCSI devices. This would probably fail, i.e. on USB or FireWire disks. It's possible to add these types of disks, but limiting the app to only known subset of possible devices seems to be rather bad idea.</p></li>
<li><p>looks like HDIO_GET_IDENTITY works only on IDE and SATA drives.</p></li>
<li><p>/sys/block hack may not work on other than IDE or SATA drives.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas on how to improve this schema? Perhaps there is another way to determine windows names without writing all the data in windows app?</p>

Time:     [ 2:00 PM]

============================================================
</pre>

<p>When you click submit, it calls the same AddTask function.</p>

<p>Is this considered:  </p>

<ul>
<li>a good way to code</li>
<li>just for the newbies</li>
<li>horrendous!.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong>  </p>

<p>I'm noticing a trend here for ""shared library called by both the GUI and CLI executables."" Is there some compelling reason why they would have to be separated, other than maybe the size of the binaries themselves? </p>

<p>Why not just call the same executable in different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>""todo /G""</code>  when you want the full-on graphical interface</li>
<li><code>""todo /I""</code>  for an interactive prompt <em>within</em> <code>todo.exe</code> (scripting, etc)</li>
<li>plain old <code>""todo &lt;function&gt;""</code> when you just want to do one thing and be done with it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong>  </p>

<p>It was mentioned that ""the way [I've] described things, you [would] need to spawn an executable every time the GUI needs to do something.""  </p>

<p>Again, this wasn't my intent. When I mentioned that the example GUI called ""the same <code>AddTask</code> function,"" I didn't mean the GUI called the command line program each time. I agree that would be totally nasty. I had intended (see first addendum) that this all be held in a single executable, since it was a tiny example, but I don't think my phrasing necessarily precluded a shared library.</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to thank all of you for your input. This is something that keeps popping back in my mind and I appreciate the wisdom of your experience.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for not making myself clear. Of course you're using a pipe and of course you're using stdin and stdout of the respective parts of the command. I had assumed that was too obvious to state.</p>

<p>What I'm asking is how this is handled/implemented. Since both programs cannot run at once, how is data sent from stdin to stdout? What happens if the first program generates data significantly faster than the second program? Does the system just run the first command until either it's terminated or it's stdout buffer is full, and then move on to the next program, and so on in a loop until no more data is left to be processed or is there a more complicated mechanism?</p>

"Alternatives to Windows Workflow Foundation?","<p>I've been using WWF for a while as part of an internal call center application (ASP.NET), and while learning it was a good practice in understanding how a state machine based workflow system <em>should</em> work, I am definitely not in love with WWF itself. In my opinion it is:</p>

<ol>

<li>Immature (ever worked with that horrible designer?)</li>
<li>Anemic in its current feature set</li>

<li>State machine based (mapping states to available actions)</li>
<li>A focus on user permissions (controlling who has access to what actions)</li>
<li>The ability to run workflows as timed background tasks (for example, to send out reminders for items that have been sitting in a certain state for x days)</li>

"Calling ASP.NET web service from ASP using SOAPClient","<p>I have an ASP.NET webservice with along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>[WebService(Namespace = ""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing"")]
[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
[ToolboxItem(false)]
public class ProvisioningService : WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public XmlDocument ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message)
    {
        // ... do stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am calling the web service from ASP using something like:</p>

<pre><code>provWSDL = ""http://servername:12011/MessageProcessor.asmx?wsdl""
Set service = CreateObject(""MSSOAP.SoapClient30"")
service.ClientProperty(""ServerHTTPRequest"") = True
Call service.MSSoapInit(provWSDL)

xmlMessage = ""&lt;request&gt;&lt;task&gt;....various xml&lt;/task&gt;&lt;/request&gt;""
result = service.ProcessMessage(xmlMessage)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am encountering is that when the XML reaches the ProcessMessage method, the web service plumbing has added a default namespace along the way. i.e. if I set a breakpoint inside ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message) I see:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;request xmlns=""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing""&gt;
  &lt;task&gt;....various xml&lt;/task&gt; 
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I capture packets on the wire I can see that the XML sent by the SOAP toolkit is slightly different from that sent by the .NET WS client. The SOAP toolkit sends:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope 
    xmlns:SOAPSDK1=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" 
    xmlns:SOAPSDK2=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""

            &lt;message xmlns:SOAPSDK4=""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing""&gt;
                &lt;request&gt;
                    &lt;task&gt;...stuff to do&lt;/task&gt;
                &lt;/request&gt;

        &lt;/ProcessMessage&gt;
    &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst the .NET client sends:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soap:Envelope 
    xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" 
    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""

<p>When viewing the font in the browser it looks correct - since all client computers have the font installed...</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Ryan, your post to the FAQ solved the problem. Installing the fonts on the server fixes the print problem, as well as problems with charts (which are also rendered on the server). Like you point out (as well as being mentioned in the FAQ) Reporting Services 2005 does not do font embedding in PDF files. I guess that is okay for now - the most important part was being able to hit print and get the correct fonts.</p>

<p>The reason the fonts didn't show up straight away is answered in the FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: I've installed the font on my client/server but I still see ?'s or
  black boxes. Why?</strong> A: For the client
  machine, closing all instances of the
  PDF viewer then reopening them should
  fix the issue.</p>
  
  <p>For the server, restarting the
  services should allow the PDF renderer
  to pick up the new font information.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, I have also seen times
  where I needed a full machine reboot
  to get the client/server to recognize
  the newly installed font.</p>

<p>Now, obviously I could implement the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.ixmlserializable.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">IXmlSerializable</a> interface and then chuck a reader/writer to it but I would like to avoid that since it then means I need to instantiate a reader/writer whenever I want to do it, and 99.99% of the time I am going to be working with a <em>string</em> so I may just write my own.</p>
<p>However, to serialize to XML, I am simply decorating the class and its members with the <em>Xml???</em> attributes ( <em>XmlRoot</em> , <em>XmlElement</em> etc.) and then passing it to the <em>XmlSerializer</em> and a <em>StringWriter</em> to get the string. Which is all good. I intend to put the method to return the string into a generic utility method so I don't need to worry about type etc.</p>

<li><p>It circumvents my well architectured MVP framework - with databinding, the view communicates bi-directionally with a model.  Ewww.</p></li>
<li><p>It promotes hooking up view controls to datafields at design time.  In my experience, this leads to vital code (binding column A to Field X) being obscure and hidden away in some designer file.  IMO this code should be explicit and in-your-face, so that it is easy to modify and see what is going on, without having to use a clunky designer interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Relating to Point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component (view, model, controller/presenter) and unit-test.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The pros are that it is easy to set up, and you can take advantage of some nice features (validation etc) which come with the plumbing already done for you.  </p>

<p>But for me, databinding becomes much more of a hindrance when dealing with a large data-centric application.</p>

"mod_rewrite rule to redirect all requests except for one specific path","<p>I'm trying to redirect all requests to my domain to another domain using mod_rewrite in an Apache 2.2 VirtualHost declaration.  There is one exception to this -- I'd like all requests  to the <code>/audio</code> path <em>not</em> to be redirected.</p>

<p>I've written a RewriteCond and RewriteRule to do this but it's not quite right and I can't figure out why.  The regular expression contains a negative lookahead for the string ""/audio"", but for some reason this isn't matching.  Here's the definition:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net(?!/audio) [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newdomain.net [L,R=301]
</code></pre>

<p>If I change the RewriteCond to:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net/(?!audio) [NC]
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e. put the forward slash outside of the negative lookahead part) then it works, but the downside of this is that requests to mydomain.net without a trailing slash will not be redirected.</p>

<p>Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>(Note: the angle brackets around the domain in the RewriteRule bit above are being added by StackOverflow.com -- they are not there in the actual code!)</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ServerAdmin me@mydomain.net
DocumentRoot ""/var/www/mydomain.net/htdocs""
ServerName www.mydomain.net
ServerAlias mydomain.net

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond {REQUEST_URI} !^/audio
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newdomain.net [L,R=301]
RewriteLog logs/mod_rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 3

ErrorLog logs/error_log
CustomLog logs/access_log common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Thanks @mercutio -- that makes perfect sense but it still doesn't seem to work.  </p>

<p>Here's what the mod_rewrite log says when I make a request to <a href=""http://mydomain.net/audio/something.mp3"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://mydomain.net/audio/something.mp3</a>:</p>

<pre><code>(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /audio/something.mp3
(3) applying pattern '^(.*)$' to uri '/audio'
(2) rewrite '/audio' -&gt; 'http://www.newdomain.net/'
(2) explicitly forcing redirect with http://www.newdomain.net
(1) escaping http://www.newdomain.net for redirect
(1) redirect to http://www.newdomain.net [REDIRECT/301]

<p>Since the REQUEST_URI does start with <code>/audio</code> I would expect the RewriteRule to be ignored.</p>

"Enforcing required function call","<p>I have a ""Status"" class in C#, used like this:</p>

     return new Status(false, ""Something went wrong"")
   else
     return new Status(true, ""OK"");

<p>You get the idea.
All callers of MyFunction <em>should</em> check the returned Status:</p>

<pre><code>Status myStatus = MyFunction();
if ( ! myStatus.IsOK() )
   // handle it, show a message,...

<p>Lazy callers however can ignore the Status.</p>

<pre><code>MyFunction(); // call function and ignore returned Status

<pre><code>{
  Status myStatus = MyFunction(); 
} // lose all references to myStatus, without calling IsOK() on it

<p><strong>In general</strong>: is it possible to write a C# class on which you <em>have</em> to call a certain function?</p>

<p>In the C++ version of the Status class, I can write a test on some private bool bIsChecked in the <em>destructor</em> and ring some bells when someone doesn't check this instance.</p>

<p>What is the equivalent option in C#?
I read somewhere that ""You don't want a destructor in your C# class""</p>

<p>Is the Dispose method of the IDisposable interface an option?</p>

<p>In this case there are no unmanaged resources to free.
Additionally, it is not determined <em>when</em> the GC will dispose the object.
When it eventually gets disposed, is it still possible to know where and when you ignored that specific Status instance?
The ""using"" keyword does help, but again, it is not <em>required</em> for lazy callers.</p>
